       "  'text': 'GSB is basically a sandbox game where you design ships and set them to battle other fleets and watch the outcome. The idea is to create a force that can win the battle wtih minimum amount of force (resources) and with minimum amount of casualties, usually by exploting a particular enemy\\'s formation, weapons, shields, fleet composition, and so on. You have 3 classes of ships: fighters, frigates, and cruisers. Each needs to be fitted with engine, powerplant, shield(s), armor, weapons, crew, and other equipment (scanners, jammers, and more). Different weapons have different stats. Some are good against shields, others against armor. Some cycle faster but are weaker, while others may load slowly but punch hard. Cruisers may be vulnerable to swarm of fighters getting inside its shields, while frigates are usually pounded into pieces by cruiesrs, but are usually death to frighters (if armed with the right weapons). You also control the fleet\\'s placement on the map and can give specific orders, like \"primarily engage fighters\".\\nThere are dozens of preset scenarios (battles), 10 different races (each with unique combination of ship designs and special weapons), as well as ability to challenge other players (can you do better than my battle?) and fleet vs. fleet machups.\\nOnce you set your formation and fleet, just hit \"start the battle\" and watch your ships fight it out based on the orders you\\'ve given, to the best of their ability.\\nAs you win battles, you gain prestige points which are used to unlock more advanced equipments and ship hull designs.\\nAll in all, GSB is an interesting toy that feels at times like a huge puzzle, But it is so addictive, much like setting two ant farms together and have them fight. Give it a try, despite its two-D presentation. You may end up liking it a lot and can\\'t stop playing.',\n",

Click on the map location you want and your character is instantly there.\\nAll the puzzles are trivially easy, and the gameplay itself mainly consists of dialog trees. You click on all the dialog options in order while the game tells you its story. This is a good thing, though. A game like this is all about the story, and difficult puzzles just interrupt the storytelling.\\nIf you\\'d just like to be told a story and you hate the gameplay in traditional point-and-click adventures, this is the adventure game for you.',\n",

       "  'text': '4/10\\nWhile I appreciate that Card City Nights is trying to create a fresh and interesting take on card games, I can\\'t say it really succeeds. However, the system of connecting one card to another through the arrows on the periphery of the cards has some potential. Some things that might benefit the game include some deck-building statistics in the builder. Let me organize my collection by symbol: for instance, if I click a shield in the deck-builder, only show me cards that include that symbol (including two symbol cards). Additionally, let me organize by arrow: if I click on the left arrow or left upper arrow, only show me cards that feature this. This would greatly benefit players who want to dig into the system that you\\'ve created.\\nThe main issue with the game, in my opinion, is the booster feature. Whenever you beat an opponent, you get a booster with random cards from one of the featured sets. Some of the opponents can be played repeatedly to earn extra boosters, but often these are \"best of 3\" matches and can take some time. But this is a single-player game, this isn\\'t Magic the Gathering. Just give the player certain cards after they beat certain opponents - I don\\'t think it\\'s a wise move to build grinding into your game. Though perhaps certain players feel excited opening boosters, I never used boosters in the entirety of my time playing Magic the Gathering (many, many years). I always bought on secondary markets where I could pick the cards I needed. You can buy individual cards from some of the vendors in the game, but the majority of the cards are underwhelming and overpriced.\\nThe \"best of 3\" matches take a while, because the majority of the time it seems like the best strategy is to either have your opponent run out of cards or have him be unable to place one on the board. Attacking the opponent would be faster, but this strategy seems less viable to me than the others I mentioned. Opponents begin dropping cards with two symbols quite early in the game, meaning that only two cards are needed to create a combo. Some of the cards that opponents drop are absurdly powerful, and if you don\\'t have an answer immediately you\\'ll be in trouble. One opponent dropped a card that removed one card from my deck every turn - another dropped a card that disabled a random card on the board every turn (this almost always seemed to target my cards). The cards I had access to just seemed uninteresting and underpowered in comparison.\\nLastly, this game has a fantastic soundtrack. Skip the game and spend your money on the soundtrack instead.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I feel the best way to express my love for this game, is through story.\\nThere I was, an average gamer guy not unlike yourself, looking for a game to play. Dungeons of Dredmor stood out above the rest of my Steam library, like a beacon of light sent by the Great God of Lutefisk himself. At this point, I had only 11 hours into the game. I had enjoyed my time with it, but it wasn't my go-to PC game. I started it up and built a character; a dual axe-wielding berserker, and I called him Tittle.\\nThe next three straight hours were an escapade only matched by the likes of Space Pirate Indiana Jones, and even THAT'S giving the guy too much credit. Tittle had fought and destroyed countless adversaries. Diggles, Genies, and Golems alike all fell to the mighty swings of Tittle's axes. Successfully clearing three stories of the titular Dungeon of Dredmor, our hero stumbled upon none other than a Monster Zoo. Having successfully cleared another Zoo on the previous floor, Tittle was confident in his ability to clear another.\\nAnd, like many other great heroes before him, Tittle's hubris proved to be his undoing. Tittle was struggling, killing enemies left right and center, but struggling all the same. His health dropped faster than it regenerated, his food supply was running low. Still, he fought hard.\\nAnd I'll be damned, that was the most beautiful fight I've ever seen. Finally, with only a couple dozen monsters left, Tittle was flanked by two bosses. Brave, inscrutable, and ruggedly handsome to the end, Tittle breathed his last.\\nAll jokes aside, I can't recommed this game enough. The best thing I can say about it is just that's it's incredibly fun. It's genuinely funny, the RPG and roguelike elements are very solid, and the sprite work and enemy design is nothing short of amazing. And it's DIRT CHEAP. Hours of fun for less that $5? I'd say that's a pretty good deal.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Edit: only 1/3 ppl found this review helpful, really?\\nOk I'll add that the game mechanics are smooth for controlling the ship, Style is a little rpg like, you take turns on your abilities as they have a cool down but you also have your basic attacks. The loading screens are very seemless and tho noticeable they fit the game well. It is for the most part a big open world if you can consider the fast travel loading screens as something you'd probably do in real life in space anyways... The missions are varied but it's usually go here, and destroy, defend, capture...that kinda stuff. It's fun. May feel repetitive. This is not a game where after 20 hours you feel like you're really experiencing something new, but there are skill trees and goals to achieve. With a VR headset this might be a great game to go back to every other day for an hr or two and just go like WOW VR is cool, ok now im gonna go play something else with a bit more of an unique experience which that's debatable as everyone defines a unique experience in different ways. So what might be unique to me, might be different than what you wish for. So far I continue to like this game and I need to play it some more...but time constraints have gotten in the way.\\nJust awesome.\\nGame works great on my weak laptop and still looks so good.\\nGreat multiplayer sci-fi game. You don't need to pay to win so far but I am still a low level character so I don't know a lot. Will review again later. But so far so good. A bit of a tiny learning curve. Reassigning keys was a must for me. Also prob a good idea to play this game with a 360 controller which I will try soon and re-review how that experience went.\\nSo far I like this game. Will continue to play and it's future oriented as it has VR capabilities.\",\n",

The game introduced the over-cinematic, highly scripted gameplay that everyone unnecessarily cries about when talking about CoD but of course no one cares because it\\'s Valve. Honestly? The game\\'s a mess. It\\'s very short. The difficulty is downright atrociously done. The setting is unique but due to a serious lack of even one single actual character the game can\\'t tell the story everyone thinks it does so well.\\nI quit the game when I found an itch-...whatever you call the underwater creature thing, flying around trying to attack a helicopter. This game is terrible. A 96 on Metacritic? How about 60.\\n++Weapons feel great\\n++AI is fantastic, even if many AI details go unnoticed\\n+Headshots are especially meaty\\n+Great gibs\\n+Voice-acting is very good\\n+Enemy variety is nice, if not generic or a total rip off\\n+-Sound design is average\\n-+Music is decent if utterly forgettable\\n+-It\\'s short, but admittedly only as short as Quake II, but this doesn\\'t have the replayability of Quake II\\n-+Weapons are generic and some useless\\n-Level design makes no sense. Why would you have a massive pit with hanging crates? Why does Black Mesa have a meat processing factory connected to a sewer?\\n-Games looked terrible for 1998. At a time where every year introduced marginal graphical innovations Half-Life was far behind the times. Quake from 1996 looks far better than this at 1080p.\\n-Despite having supposedly incredible, innovative storytelling there are no characters other than one who only appears once in the whole game to talk to you\\n-The constant set-pieces, while being impressive means this game has little replayability as there are no sandbox surprises or open ended level design, which is exactly why we remember late 90\\'s FPS as being so fantastic\\n-Loading screens every 2 seconds\\n-Sticky ladders suck\\n-Way too much platforming, which is made even worse by how this game has some of the worst movement in FPS\\n--The game is a joke and ruins whatever atmosphere it tries to create due to unleashing its arsenal of glitches whenever it gets the chance (e.g scientist jumps out of window running away from zombies and says to you \"I see you are from the physical labs, yes.\")\\n--Easy and medium is very easy\\n--Hard equals bullet sponge enemies. A soldier should not take 4 shotgun rounds square to the head to die, nor should a bullsquid have to be blown up by a grenade directly under him and then finished off with 2 point-blank shotgun rounds for it to actually die.\\n--Some story people who talk at you don\\'t a lot of the time because this game\\'s a glitchy mess, even more so in this Source version\\n--In a time where arena FPS was king, this had no bots\\n--In fact, the multiplayer was utter unbalanced rubbish\\n--The stupid slippery movement makes me want to ♥♥♥♥ing cry\\nSound: 6/10\\nGraphics: 4/10\\nGameplay: 7.5/10\\nContent/Replayability: 3/10\\nOverall: 4/10\\nI don\\'t like using the word overrated and underrated as it\\'s all down to opinion and people can see things wildy different to others, which is needless to say, but the very fact that I can glitch this game out in the very first seconds of so-called \\'gameplay\\' (gameplay which involves you standing there doing nothing in a square for 10 minutes) meanwhile everyone complains about the state of FPS nowadays while completely ignoring how this started most of those complaints may be the definition of overrated.\\nThis game has been constantly updated by Valve ever since release. You don\\'t see glitches so bad in Unreal, and that didn\\'t get non-stop patches for a decade straight. It\\'s worth one playthrough. That\\'s it. Just move onto the far, far, far superior sequels instead. Hell, even the expansions did more things right than this.\\nThis game is the Queen of video games. Decent at times, but no where near as good as people give it credit for. Yes I just insulted Queen and this game. I truly am a hipster and there\\'s no way I won\\'t get a downvote for at least one of those reasons.',\n",

Go to compatibility, select Windows 98, also, reduce the colour mode, along with the bits, alongside applying it to run in 640 x 480 resolution.\\nThink you’re done? Nope. You just applied for a part time job as a computer technician.\\nNext issue, it will ask you to insert the CD. That’s right, the digital copy you purchased, most likely for the main reason of having easy access to a childhood game, will ask you for a CD.\\nSo, the main way you’ll be able to resolve this is if you delete the audio folder in your steam apps, and replacing it with the CD versions audio folder, thankfully, I kept my CD for this part, if not, you have to illegally torrent the game, but if you do so, you won’t have the fun of troubleshooting.\\nDon’t worry, it gets better, the game can now load and you can play it, however, the audio will not be compatible with the game itself, so you won’t hear anything. No awesome 80s music or Haitians dying in the streets.\\nThe final step, refund this mess that steam provided to you, with no warnings or disclaimers and throw that CD that you kept in perfect condition for the last 14 years at the wall.',\n",

       "  'text': '6.5/10 - If You Aren\\'t Too Particula; This One May Be For You!\\nI really love Tower Defense so I tend to have some high expectations; this one definitely doesn\\'t blow my mind but offers some cool elements to make it worth that $1. So our group had a surplus of these free Particula keys (30) so we all launched yesterday at 9:30 to investigate. Verdict = Really Fun. I highly recommend the Multiplayer; you must bring your own friends though which sucks!\\nThe TD takes place within the human mind. Your towers are some sort of brain synapses that must eradicate negative thoughts such as jealousy, greed, self-consciousness and other negative thoughts that would cross one’s mind. Pretty clever on that front; this allowed the minimalist graphics to actually work and make sense. The levels are quite long and almost AFKable with some friends\\nThere are quite a few things that didn\\'t work for me. There was no tutorial; I was super confused at the start. Stick with it because the learning curve is quick. Multiplayer \"works\" but it’s dead since few play this game on the regular. There are only 3 levels to alternate between which include 6-7 levels of difficulty. This is cool but I\\'d rather have more variance in the maps instead. Finally, the chat box is MICRO; you can only type and read so much. Communication in multiplayer almost has to be done with voice to be effective.\\nOverall, not bad for $1! It\\'s short and you need to BYOF (Bring Your Own Friends.) Free at Accidently Reviewed!',\n",

       "  'text': \"It's DOOM. Play this if you like old-school games, gaming history and/or well-designed shooters & somehow haven't tried it yet. What else is there to say about it?\\nAlright, I'll give it a shot. In 1993, ID Software more or less revolutionized the first-person shooter genre\\nwith a game that was not only blazingly fast and good-looking for the time, but played and aged so well it inspired a fanbase that persists to this day.\\nThere have been tens of thousands of custom maps and modifications for Doom and its immediate sequel over the years that take the game in every conceivable direction, and while the 'Doomer' fandom isn't exactly the monstrously huge construction you'd expect to find camping on tumblr*, there's no sign of Doom being truly abandoned any time soon.\\nYou might think, yeah, it was good in its day, but it looks so crude and simple today. Why would anyone still play it? Well, apart from the huge realm of custom content, Doom's gameplay is simply very, very well-tuned. It's a little comparable to bullet hell or chess, in that there's more focus on dodging enemy attacks than there is on tanking them.\\nDoom's monster AI is simple yet open-ended enough to make for a wide variety of tactical situations, and the player's movement & weaponry aren't any less finely crafted. The\\ncriticism that I can think of is that the gatling gun (which is also incorrectly referred to as a 'chaingun') more or less replaces your starting pistol.\\nBasically, it's easy to get into, but has enough nuance and depth to carry itself even today. For a while after it was released, games in a similar style were explicitly called 'Doom clones'. To the modern observer, Doom managed to drive progress in the genre enough that in hindsight there really wasn't much shame to be had in being a 'clone' of such an excellent game. (\\n)\\nYou can't look up or down either, at least not in the game's original form. While there's absolutely something to be said for Doom's purity of form (and compensating autoaim), the ability to look in any direction is kind of a boon for newer games.\\nYou probably wouldn't want to play this for the story: you'll literally only find the setup in the game's manual. There's just enough story to justify what's happening in the game, although what's there is good for what it is.\\nOnce the technology was in place, Doom also became a catalyst for early online gaming. This game is, in fact, where the term 'deathmatch' came from. There's\\n\\navailable to play Doom with or against other people, without the murderous rates people had to pay 20 years ago. Perhaps bare-bones in comparison to today's offerings, but certainly faster in pace and intensity.\\nSteam's included DOSBox port is pretty poor, so I would recommend grabbing a sourceport like Chocolate Doom or GZDoom. Those two are my personal favorites - the former lets you experience the game as it was in the '90s, and the latter lets you easily load all sorts of modern mods and enhancements.\\nDoom's default controls are frankly a relic from the pre-WASD standard days, but fortunately pretty much every sourceport lets you change the controls and even look up & down if you wish. I would recommend at least trying the original controls, though, if you're going to start playing Doom.\\nIf you\\nwant to experience classic Doom, you'd do well to pick up its\\nat the very least. It adds new enemies and one new weapon, not to mention 32 new levels, and it's been more popular with custom level designers ever since it came out in 1994. That may not sound like much, but then again, if it ain't broke...\\nAs of this humble summation of Doom, the game in question has persisted for 23 years. I would seriously bet that it will last 23 more.\\n*Not that I particularly dislike tumblr.\",\n",

I want to say \"not as good as it should be\" but instead I find myself saying \"Not good or fun at all.\" I give a lot of chances especially to something I want to be good, this took 3 mind numbing chances after waiting a while for the bugs to be worked out first. Give it a try of course, but don\\'t expect much at all.\\nLong Version :\\nRunning back and forth between 2 characters over 6 times before killing or collecting an item is downright boring as hell. I have played Ragnarok Online the original and it was/is much better than playing Ragnarok Online 2. The game went 3D and lost all value in community and leveling gain. After multiple times of scrapping and redoing the game it should have been much better than this.\\nTime should have gone to giving Ragnarok Online 1 a huge update or cloning the game with a different storyline. This was awful and I cant play anymore than the 8 hours I have pushing myself to like it. Sorry Gravity but you value your profits too much for this game to be any good.\\nAnime cut-scenes were interesting. New card system is not as inspiring. Music loops so much it may have made me nauseous, Running up and down a hill shows obvious bugs that should have been fixed in Korean Beta, none of my costumes fit me (hat was floating 4 feet aboive my ehad at all times) All of the items are timed. Peco usage for 3 days. VIP access was generous but pointless, the people are NOT fun to play/talk with (original has that locked down better than any game)',\n",

The game mechanics are spot on and very responsive. The game tends to slow down a little when things get really busy such as massive explosions and the debris scatters everywhere while tons of dead bodies lay about. The only thing I do not like about the game is that it's no monochromatic and shows a real lack of color other than red. Sometimes when things get real busy you lose track of the cursor or sometimes even your character.  Story mode is really straight forward while challenge mode is a bit repetitive. Levels are big enough to keep you busy but once you have done the side missions, there is not much else to do. Not the best game out there but good enough to kill some time. 7/10\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Full Disclosure: I am a long-time consumer of the Unreal series, and a nearly life-long fan of both the Unreal series and Epic Games, the developer of said series. As such, I may be VERY biased, and my word might not be completely reliable, though I will try as usual to be as fair as possible.\\nUnreal Tournament is an Arena FPS whom is THE grandfather of the entire genre, of games which are entirely based upon combat in planned stages designed solely for combat, not story. It has fallen into obscurity since Unreal Tournament 2004\\'s release, so allow me to try and show you how this game became such a staple of gaming.\\nThese days, you\\'ve got games that run natively at 60fps, support resolutions for 4K monitors and ultra-wide monitors, and you\\'ve got games now which are nearly realistic for appearance. Unreal Tournament, came a bit late, but used it\\'s engine well, Unreal Engine 1, which originated in the first Unreal game, which is an Engine that, even in the 90s, was the cutting edge of graphic fidelity and quality. It stands up even now, despite using polygons, lacking facial animations, but each weapon, and each character looks great even still. Levels still look gorgeous and cool, and almost falling into space still makes me very antsy even after 12 years later.\\nThe game has only three modes. The Singleplayer Campaign, Multiplayer, and an offline skirmish-style mode titled Instant Action. The Campaign is of you, a new combatant in the newest deathsport known as the Unreal Tournament, where convicts have been turned into gladiators whom kill one another and win with the goal of becoming The Tournament Champion, effectively attaining a sort of celebrity-status. Multiplayer is smooth and reliable. There are no problems with the game itself that I\\'ve found, even with this re-release. Modes for it, are identical to Instant Action, only some maps function with people, as you don\\'t need AI pathing with human players.\\nInstant Action\\'s modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Last Man Standing, Capture The Flag, Assault and Domination.\\nThe only ones which aren\\'t obvious and in other games, are Domination and Assault, so I will describe them.\\nAssault, is by far my favorite mode in virtually any game and it is a team-based mode with two teams. One team attacks a base, completing preset objectives and eventually aiming to complete them all, while the other team\\'s objective is to stop the attacking team from completing objectives by any means.\\nOnce the attacking team completes their objectives, they win the match, should they do all objectives and both teams switch sides, the defensive team becomes the new attacker, and vice-versa. At this point, the newly attacking team must match the completion time of the other team, or they will suffer a loss of the match. Though the sides switch even if the first attackers don\\'t succeed, allowing both teams to attack and defend each match.\\nDomination, on the other hand, is a sort of variant of traditional King of The Hill gamemodes. Only there are multiple Hills, or Points, which either team (up to 4 teams, unlike other modes, save for TDM) must hold to win the match. Holding a point wil generate one score point for the team every 3 seconds or so, and holding more points will generate more.\\nIt also has something no non-Unreal title has ever really adopted whole-heartedly; Mutators. Think of a mod, imagine how annoying it is that you can\\'t just tick it on or off, or combine it with others witohut conflict for the most part. Mutators allow you to change parts of the game, like Low Gravity, and entirely different set of weapons, or powerful relics that change the game\\'s strategies, or even classics like Volatile Ammo (ammo that is shot will discharge, resulting in hilarity from shooting ammo than the enemy) and Fatboy (Where your character model gets more \"fat\" or just wider, with obvious texture stretching, based on how well you\\'re doing. Whoever wins, usually ends up being the fattest, while the one who did the worst, ends up like a skinny stick figure).\\nDue to the game being made in the 90s, the options menu isn\\'t TOO varied, but it sort of gets hte job done.\\nIt\\'s got Video Driver settings, Resolution, graphics quality, texture quality (32 bit and 16 bit), A minimum FPS setting for video settings. It has the usual for audio, which technically hasn\\'t changed for many games in years. You can alter the in-game auto-swap priority for different weapons, I personally have dual enforcers at the top above the sniper rifle. Input options are fairly varied with two different forms of sensitivity, and different mouse-based look options.\\nThe game is difficult... if you want it to be. It has quite literally 12 different difficulties, from Novice to Godlike, there\\'s almost no way anybody is too awful to play any difficulty of this game. With Novice, AI are painfully stupid, maybe even intentionally avoiding powerups in at least early singleplayer levels, whereas in Godlike, the AI become Kung-Fu gun masters, constantly know where you are and instinctually know when items respawn and always try to hog powerups aswell as having almost perfect aim and reaction, even mimicking players by spastically jumping around.\\nThis game\\'s soundtrack holds up today. In Unreal Tournament 3, most of hte songs are simply remixes of classic songs from this game, there\\'s almost no single song that hasn\\'t made it, and the music in this game are great for listenning when working out, writing, or even playing other games with.\\nThe announcer is also very well voiced. It\\'s dominantly used for custom content quite often, mostly in Gmod, though it\\'s confused for the Announcer in Quake 3 Arena... which is actually more of a knock-off with 90% less recorded dialogue and announcements.\\nThe game has barely any Story. IN the campaign, you are a newly brought-in convict in charge of your own team. Your goal? To climb the ladder of this tournament deathsport (which is canon as a sort of reality show to the human race) and to become the Tournament Champion by defeating it\\'s first champion, Xan Kreigor... who is really hard to kill in-game. That\\'s it though. You gain trophies though, and they still look cool!\\nThe game comes with a decent amount of content, but given how some still play multiplayer, and that if you look in the right places, you can find over 10 GBs worth of custome content. Given how I once had only 2 gbs of content on my copy of the game in the past, that was over 500 maps, 7 game modes, 4 mods, and many mutators.\\nSome of these maps have neutral AI players which are super-powerful and are remixed versions of other official maps, using a different theme, or maps of such quality, you\\'d think\\nSome of these custom gamemodes is the wonderful Monster Hunt, like Assault, but the defending team is always the monsters, and the players are always attacking to get to the end before losing all their lives, or the chaotic 4-Team Capture The Flag. My second favorite is Jailbreak, bbasically Team Deathmatch meets Capture The Flag. Two teams aiming to kill one another and jail them, then watch them get executed, sometimes able to have prisoners of either team pit against one another in a 1v1 where the winner goes free, and it\\'s possible to release your team by going into enemy territory.\\nThis game is simply one of my favorites. It\\'s always been one of my favorite as I can\\'t remember a time it wasn\\'t installed on my computer. Even just to play the Campaign, I\\'ve never forgotten this game, and I always have had a copy of it since I first played it when I was 10. If you like FPS games, or the idea of a gladiatorial arena-style game tickles your fancy, then pick this game up. There\\'s more custom content than what I suggested like voice packs, models, even Total Conversions and far more.\\nI recommend this due to it simply being one of the best Arena FPS\\' to ever appear on the market. I don\\'t think you\\'ll regret your purchase.',\n",

It does what it sets out to do very well but it doesn't hold up quite as well when viewed simply as an RPG. Repetitive battles are to be expected but the combat does start to feel very sloppy as you progress through the game and realize that most of your moves will become obsolete. The story also does not do a lot to drive the player forward through the adventure. RPGs are time consuming... So in order to be worth your time investment, all the elements of an RPG (the combat, the characters, the story) need to work together to enrich the experience. Cthulhu Saves the World provides bits and pieces of fun but never really delivers a full and satisfying game. For a memorable retro RPG experience, it's best to look to classic titles such as Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The fact that a game made in seven days is more unique, interesting, and entertaining than  modern AAA FPS is really telling about the genre and the gaming industry as a whole... Completely risk-averse, just like Hollywood.\\nReceiver is quite an experimental game, and the trailer pretty much shows the entire scope of it, so I'll spare talking too much about gameplay. The handling and bullet physics of the guns are the game's main selling points, and they perform quite well. You need to load every magazine yourself, eject spent casings, bullets will ricochet if fired at bad angles, etc. etc.\\nThe two enemies shown in the trailer are the only two enemies in the game, the flying drones which rush you really fast and try and stun you and the turrets. Both kill you in one hit. Not much of a variety at all, but it doesn't really need one. The drones clearly test your reflexes and the turrets your marksmanship. It could use one more to test handling in some way but that seems impossible to implement unless it somehow magically jammed your gun.\\nAll in all it works together quite nicely. The levels and your starting equipment are randomly generated and there's always some unique challenge to overcome. That said the level generation could use a few tweaks... as it tends to make impossibly hard levels with 0 ammo and about 8 turrets down a single one way path. The way you see the developers shooting multiple rounds at things in the trailer? Not a good idea. You generally want to take everything out in one shot if you can because ammo is very, very scarce, though you may get lucky! Aside from the obvious crappy graphics (the game seems to have problems with V-sync, by the way) that is my only negative.\\n7/10 seems about right.\",\n",

I can't explain how I felt about this game, most of the time, it's not the kind of game that makes me rage, it's just so lame that I struggle to say anything about it. It just feels overall...Not good.\\nI played this game for the same reason that I play many other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. I wanna live the nightmare myself, I wanna see if it's as bad as people say, and it is.\\nHere are a couple more negative points.\\n-No matter what server I play on, the lag seems to be a real and permanent issue in all of them, close or far from me, and it gets really annoying. It's fascinating when you keep doing the Wesker shuffle all along the map.\\n-Hackers. ♥♥♥♥ing hackers. Oh, so you are a little ♥♥♥♥♥ that doesn't wanna play zombie in zombie mode, and you just wanna hole like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Well, worry no more! There is a hack that allows you to zombify everyone! Even the ones that are really far away from you where you will NEVER ♥♥♥♥ING REACH THEM! And people seem to accept and even embrace that, what a ♥♥♥♥ing load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\\n-Every game mode, except for zombies, gets boring really quickly. Wait, nevermind, even zombies gets boring really quick, it's like mixing minecraft with CS zombie mods. Sounds good? Well, hackers and holing up forever and ever ruins that. You can build your own overpowered camping spot were you won't be reached.\\n-Clipping through the map. Believe me, it happens. No, it's not fun when you are holed up nice and snug and you fall to the floor below.\\n-Tank sounds. It's just a crappy sounding 1 or 2 second loop that not only feels like a cheap, poorly looped sound file, but also gets irritating in seconds.\\n-Zombies seem to be longarms, cuz they reach you from 3 or 4 blocks away when you are not behind one.\\n+It's funny when some dumb kid calls you a hacker because you can do stuff they can't. Never gets old.\\n-This game is blatantly pay to win. Sure, you get some rewards after you level up enough, but the best of the best when it comes to guns can ONLY be bought from the store. Plus, the ♥♥♥♥ing armor! Basically, if you pay, you can get armor that makes it harder for people to kill you with bodyshots,  and a helmet that basically gives you two chances to be headshotted. Yeah, seems balanced to me.\\n-This game is culturally diverse, you can find people from every filthy corner of this planet. The downside? They all seem to be minecraft humping squeakers with fascination for building♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and stuff like that. What a community!\\n-Some griefers in zombie mode just wanna see the world burn....YOUR world. They will destroy your bases and walls no matter what, or they will intentionally get close to the zombie's reach when holed up just to infect their whole team in there. What for, do you ask? POINTS. ♥♥♥♥ING POINTS.\\nEven if it's hilarious at times, the pain is not worth the gain.\\nWell, at least controlling guns ain't that hard, and the menu music is half decent :P\\nSo what can a simple woman like me do with this? I dunno, I guesss I could join the grief train and try to have fun.....Or better yet, PLAY ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.\\nStay away from this one, unless you want to torture yourself.\",\n",

It's not the fasted, but it's really good at being here and moving along, around a corner, in a blink of an eye. Like that sort of thing. If I haven't said earlier, I'm saying it now, I love it. I love it, even though you gotta sell your favorite robot part to get this other robot part because you don't have enough room in your garage.... I still love it, don't worry.\\nAlthough, there is one thing that really hurts me... It's that I need more. First off I really wish there were more robot parts used to make your robot. It bugs me.... There, not being a lot of robot parts to choose from. I mean, I need a lot of robot parts to choose from, to make my robot seem unique. Second, I want more people to play this game. When I click play, at average, I see 5 servers to choose from. And there's only 2 of those 5 servers that usually have more than 2 people in it. It feels like only a small group of people play this game... Which, there probably is a small group of people playing the game. Well, not that small, but you get it.\\nSo, I love this game, but, I wish there were more players, and more robot parts. While your at it, expand the garage a tiny bit, to go along with the more robot parts. And I guess a few more maps couldn't hurt. To bad it seems like these things would never happan. I guess it just feels good to get this out there. Cheers, with a 5/5 rate.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'So I am writing my first review for this game. Why you ask? Because its one of those \"games\" that a simple thumps up or down doesn\\'t do justice.\\nSo here is why as a game Oxenfree is bad. The game mechanics are nearly non existent and basically all you do is walk from A to B to B and back again. In between you choose the dialouges which then determine the relationship you have with the other characters. So that\\'s it, you don\\'t do much more expect switching the frequency on your radio which ends up pushing the direction mindlessly until you feel vibration in your controller. So much for the bad, but everything else is fantastic.\\nThe story is great and refreshing, the characters loveable and actually reasonable in how they react and what they do. Everything about this game from the artwork over the soundtrack to the story is amazingly done and has an incredible feeling. So that\\'s a 9/10, maybe even more. However the game mechanincs in itself, since nearly non existing are just terrible 1/10.\\nSo if you are looking for an intriguing story with loveable characters and choices that kinda do matter then this game is for you. But if you play games, because you like to play and don\\'t care much for story this game will just bore you to death.\\nI had a great time though, an awesome game, but that\\'s because I favour story above great gameplay. However it did leave me a bit unfulfilled at the end I feel like I missed out on some stuff, but is it enough for me to come back someday? Maybe, to change some choices and explore the story a bit more. Sadly when I think about it, I already dread the mindless \"press stick into the direction you wanna go\" gamemechaning, because there just not much else there.\\nAnway, If I could I would give this both; a big thumps up for everything exept gameplay and a thumps down for exactly that. In the end this game was so refreshing I still have to give it a recommend even though there could be a lot more game in this title. I grabbed it for 5€ at the steamsale, I think I would mind having payed the full price though',\n",

The game has it\\'s buggy problems, but nothing that hinders game play experience when fixed.\\nPros:\\n+ Prepare to invest some good time into this game. It\\'s addictive and the open world is filled with quests and decisions to be made. You will have long game sessions in this game.\\n+ The game really lets you embrace being a good/bad person, along with diverse dailogue choices. Karma system is one of the best I\\'ve seen and what you do effects the world around you. You can literally kill anyone you want in this game ._.\\n+ The game has a targeting/aiming system called VATS which is really cool and useful against enemies, for a game where aiming normally could use some improvements.\\n+ There\\'s a lot of interesting characters in the game that really makes the game wasteland setting more lively.\\n+ This game immerses you. It really feels like you\\'re someone in a hazardous wasteland trying to survive and helping or killing folks. Not just the game itself, but the story also immerses you into the role of your character really well.\\n+ MODS! There\\'s a mod for everything! X_X\\n+ My Dad in Fallout 3 was a better father to me than my IRL Dad lol XD Why isn\\'t he real (╥_╥) \"Be careful, sweetie\", \"That\\'s my girl\". Kindest words any father figure has ever told me.\\nCons:\\n- Getting this game to work on the first try. Prepare yourself for Do-It-Yourself fixes. There\\'s a guide with fixes fortunately that makes the process more smoother.\\n-  No sprinting option is silly, considering the character\\'s speed would test the patience of the most impatient of us. (Luckily there\\'s a mod for this too if you\\'re curious).\\n- Stealth in this game sucks...or it tries, but comes up short. You can\\'t get too close to an enemy (even from behind) or they notice you immediately. Sniping from afar is almost useless because there is no steady aim. Other than skill, sniping requires luck and tolerance.\\n- Third-person view in this game is kinda...awkward. Character movement looks and feels stiff. Camera isn\\'t great in third person either. You can\\'t even see your character\\'s face without it feeling like a struggle to turn the camera. My suggestion: Playing in first person felt much better to me, and that\\'s coming from someone who prefers third person view any day. Your aim is also much more accurate than in third person view.\\nOh,  and watch out for jump scares in first person view lol.\\nMy Rating: 9 out of 10. Just by solving the few cons I mentioned, I would definitely give this game a strong 10/10.',\n",

The problem is I didn't like the main character just like I didn't like the main characters in the Edna and Harvey series. When you can't identify with the character, it looses its power. Still, it was an enjoyable enough of a game and I do look forward to its sequel. I still highly reccomend buying the daedalic pack on its 90% of sale. All the games combined are totally worth it.

       "  'text': \"It's a game with a lot of soul.\\nIt's not too complicated, and while the studio that developed it isn't that big but every update they're making substantial improvements to the game. They added an escape mode recently, and are constantly reworking things based on fan input and all that jazz.\\nTruly fantastic. Give it a try.\\n----\\nGameplay: This game is deceptively simple. You'll think you have the hang of it until it you realize you've made one mistake, try to fix it, and watch everything fall apart. A game that's easy to be good at, but hard to master, and perhaps the most fun if you're not good at all.\\nGraphics/Visual Experience: While Prison Architect looks like an indie game, playing the game will reveal that this really works out as a strength. The game can get quite chaotic, and if the graphics were any different than they are the game would slow to a crawl not long after starting a new prison.\\nSound: There's not a lot of different sounds in Prison Architect, another way in which the simplicity is nice. If you like listening to music while you play without feeling like you're missing out on anything, this is your game.\\nReplayability: The game isn't terribly restrictive. Prisoners are (I think) both randomly generated and drawn from a pool of names of people who contributed money towards the game's development. The number of random elements per game means that each playthrough is quite unique, even if you did your best to make them the same.\\nHow it Runs: No computer should have a hard time running this unless you decide to do what I did, in which I gave all my prisoners a lighter and they decided to set the whole prison on fire. That got a little challenging for my computer to handle.\",\n",

Like the description says, you can learn how to play in a matter of minutes but it will take a lifetime to master.\\nThe basic idea of the game is to build more train lines than your opponents, this is done by matching the colour of the line with the colour of a train cart. You get different coloured train carts out of a deck of cards.\\nThe game has a very good built in turtorial video and lessons which explains this all in an easy to understand way. It can look very daunting at first but it soon becomes apparent that it is a very simple idea behind it all.\\nSadly from my 3 hours playing, I haven't once been able to find a match online against anyone, mainly because I get an ingame error message when ever I try and find or start an online game, so my review is based purely on the single-player aspect, and while I haven't actually won a game of Ticket to Ride, I did enjoy my time playing.\\nI'm not sure who this game is aimed at, but since there is a physical board game for Ticket to Ride, I'd say only pick this up if you enjoy the board game, but I can't really recommend this game for anyone else, £6,99 is a bit much for this, and £14,99 for the complete pack is utterly silly.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When you first start the game the initial feelings you\\'ll have are those of relief and happiness because the game looks absolutely stunning but the performance is also amazing and not a PC killer like the first game. There are no stutters or drops like there was in that one and I managed to keep a steady 60 FPS for the whole game on the highest settings. The opening is gripping, fun and thrilling with a great theme which invokes feelings of heroism and adventure and you just know you\\'re in for a hell of a ride with this one.\\n\\nMovement and combat have been streamlined to be easier and smoother than in the first game and you could make the argument that it\\'s been dumbed down to a degree but I didn\\'t have a problem with it initially. The first game got a bit cumbersome at times, things like automatic ammo pickup from dead enemies has been added, you no longer have to switch to strength mode to jump high or to speed mode to run fast. That got a bit annoying in the first one to be honest but I did find myself missing it at times while playing. The mechanics were deeper in the first one but the jungle setting and open map was a bigger playground where you could use those mechanics to its full potential. This game is more of a linear action shooter and in that context streamlining is welcome. The first game had a schizophrenic identity, presenting itself as a realistic shooter with sci-fi elements before going full sci-fi in the end and that was a bad move which hurt my enjoyment of it. At least this one has some sense of identity.\\n\\nThe AI still isn\\'t that great though, I noticed that some times if I\\'m far enough away and pick enemies off they\\'ll just stand where they are despite taking several hits, not even returning fire. I also saw an enemy behind cover shooting blindly over the wall after I\\'d destroyed it. Despite all the improvements to fluidity I don\\'t like how much they changed the gameplay from open world tactics to corridor shooting. I can only abide NPC\\'s yelling at me to go here or there so much. The \"tactical options\" feature is also a bit too pandering for my taste. Let me explore the level and figure it out on my own instead of just telling me exactly what to do. It\\'s annoying when NPC\\'s tell me to follow them but I can\\'t proceed because I\\'m waiting for them to open the door to the next area.\\n\\nThe premise is exiting and mysterious however, coming off the first game you have no idea what has happened in the last 3 years and the opening shows you the world and how it\\'s changed instead of just outright telling you. I like that and it really made me interested in finding out more about the story and the world. There are collectibles in this game but they\\'re not plot essential so the focus is squarely on the combat, not exploration. The change of setting to New York was a good move and I love it when they do things like this in a sequel. Give me the same thing, only different. It\\'s not a clone of the first game but it\\'s not too different either. It\\'s super cool to jump around on rooftops, shooting people behind cover in mid air while jumping over them, ect. The gameplay is a lot of fun and maybe a bit less tactical this time around but it caters to a different taste than the first one did.',\n",

When you're pitted against a smart player in the role of the monster and clever team mates, it's a very tense and testing game that's quite different from anything else out there. I'm not much of a fan of multiplayer shooters but this is much more satisfying to master than twitch reactions.\\nOf course playing as the monster is a whole other game unto itself and requires a different mind set to master but only understanding of playing as both sides will give you a real edge. Not enough games let you play as big horrible nasties like this and it's a part of Evolve that almost feels under developed given how fresh it is, especially in a multiplayer game.\\nI think the tiers of unlocks is a bit needlesss though, something to pull in the CoD crowd but thanks to some great balance and smart design, it's usually very rewarding regardless of which class you play as. The one upside to the avalanche of characters is that each one is unique beyond the superficial, with their own weapons and play styles. Same goes for the monster. Learning new characters and whole classes becomes its own little mini-game.\\nSo basically if you can get it on sale or cheap, absolutely worth your time provided you're willing to come to it with some patience and perhaps a few friends.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I think the issue with most people that bought this game is that they expected something similar to TWD 1 or TWD 2 and they didn’t take into consideration that we are talking about Michonne here. The cinematic feel the game has goes toe to toe with the main character, after all, as seen in the comics and series, Michonne is a killer, lighting fast that has become a new age samurai if you want to put it like that. Her life is full of death and tragedy, having lost countless people during her travels and I think this mini-series was focused on that. I enjoyed the game, though it did feel too quick, they could have added perhaps one or two more episodes, I wouldn’t have minded. Now, while I understand some people might complain that most of their choices don’t matter, I’ll add that the important ones do matter and the minor ones, as seen with previous TWD make little impact, perhaps change the way some conversations go, additionally, people are forgetting that the length of those games was at least double and hence, it made more sense for some things. All in all, I do recommend to buy and play the game and for those still not sure, then just wait for a discount.',\n",

RPG-lite with quick turn-based combat, minimal resource management, and a simplistic light-hearted story sprinkled with puns.  You fully heal HP after every fight and the game emphasizes on quickly finishing fights by making enemies stronger over each round and giving you more MP restoration for battles that end in a few turns.  Forced random encounters in each zone are limited so if you run that number out you don't have to fight anymore in that zone unless you choose to.  The music in this one was actually pretty good in some places, and as with BoDVII you can conveniently remap the controls to work on one hand so you can relax or eat something while you play.  I accrued about 8 hours of playtime and did a few extra dungeons.  Not a bad game, especially since its comes pretty cheap.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I was very excited about Season 2 when it got announced. Season 1 of Telltale\\'s The Walking Dead was my favourite game of 2012 and I got introduced to the whole franchise through that game. Because of that, I\\'ve pre-ordered S2, which is something that I\\'ve never done with a Telltale game before. (I do appreciate my efforts for trying it out something new, playing the game from the start and waiting for the upcoming Episodes, but I also regret it a bit because of the waiting between Episodes)\\nSeason 2 had a rough start, some really unmemorable characters and it basically lacked any central plot. Truth be told, I thought only Episode One was decent at best, while Episodes Two & Three and Four were actually between Good-Great and it wasn\\'t until the Season Finale where I\\'ve finally said that the ride was absolutely worth it. But was it worth the wait?\\nIn short, both yes and no. It was worth the wait because of all the crazy stuff we witnessed in the Season Finale, but it also wasn\\'t worth it, because the overall Season had some really rough parts that could have been fixed with better writing. It\\'s safe to say that the Season Finale, while it was incredible, it was also a \"bit too late\" at that point. People\\'s reactions with the entirety of the Season have been mixed; some liked it, some thought it was just filler.\\nWhile I like Clementine, I still feel that playing with Lee in Season 1 was better. His actions had bigger influences on future events, while playing with Clementine I felt that none of the people I\\'ve met in the game considered me or my actions seriously. It also felt weird that many of adults relied on a little kid during intense moments.\\nI also have to give credit to Season 2 for being more inventive and giving us scenarios that have never really been done in the comics and the TV show (for example, Walkers on the frozen lake).\\nIt all boils down to this. Season 1 had better writing and memorable characters, while Season 2 had more creativity. I highly recommend both Seasons, although I don\\'t blame you if you won\\'t end up liking Season 2 as much as Season 1, because let\\'s be honest here; Telltale set the bar way too high with S1.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WARNING: This game has a serious supernatural theme from start to finish and is not suitable for a ‘genuine’ Christian. This review will also contain spoilers in order to highlight how very careless and ill-informed the games storytelling ability is and how the design mechanics of the game is rather misleading. If I have come to realise anything about jetdogs is that they love to butcher history and cover it up by pleasing a numbed audience with over the top (OTT) animations.\\nThe story revolves around the protagonist Eva an orphan inheriting an old estate in Prague from an unknown relative (Carl). Once arrived, you meet Anna (a creepy assistant) and then immediately some apparitions (ghosts) who try to get your attention by freaking you out while at the same time pointing you in various directions so that you can break a spell which prevents you from communicating with the dead. All this has been set up by your nemesis in the game known as the ‘black alchemists’. Once the spells are broken the ghosts inform you that the black alchemists have already created a golem (basically a lobotomised version of the ‘Thing’ from the ‘Fantastic Four’). And are in the process of creating a ‘Super Golem’ (A Godzilla sized Golem) which will then proceed to go on a crushing rampage and destroy the world. To create this monster they need to sacrifice a person who is of royal lineage and you become informed that you are just such a person. Isn’t life a bummer?\\nIt seems Carl faked his own death so that you would be lead to this place in Prague where they could kill you at their own leisure. A slight oversight of your father who became aware of these diabolical ‘super golem’ plans and decided to hide you and your sister in different orphanages so that the evil black alchemists could not find you. Needless to say you eventually fault their ‘rule this world’ plan, by finding a ritual which is a kill switch to the golem, all the bad people die ‘off screen’, and you decide to have babies with a guy you have met for 10 seconds, but think he might be someone to live happily ever after with because he didn’t think you were a complete nut job when you mentioned the word ‘reanimated’. The ending is so cheesy that snapping your own neck to save you from this experience might be tempting.\\nIs the game scary? Hell no. The thing is, with old ghost stories or the old black and white horror movies is that instead of showing you everything, they would instead only slightly hint to an  unknown existence. An unknown noise source, a unfamiliar distorted shadow in the distance, a strange unaccustomed flicker of a light, which is much more scarier than flashing cheap comical animations at you of bleeding walls and skeleton hands trying to grab you as they manifest out of nowhere into the present and the like of such simply for cheap thrills. Instead, such notions just robs the story of having any credibility whatsoever.\\nThe story is loosely based on a real story about a rabbi who was stated of having successfully created a golem in Prague. Since Jewish times a Golem always referred to clay/mud being magically brought into existence and is somewhat at the beck and call of the one who brings the monster into being. The concept all stems from the first man Adam being formed out of dust and being a shell of a person (a golem) before God brought him into existence with the breath of life. Jewish folklore has always been fascinated with this concept of whether a casing of a person can be formed first out of the ground and life be transported into it somehow and they often pointed to Psa 139:16 as being proof that such an earthly Frankenstein concept must be at least feasible.\\nThis notion was carried throughout all the various offshoots of the Jewish religion including one known as Kabbalah which eventually gave birth to Qabalah. Qabalah united the occult with the Christian Cabalistic movements. How? Basically they believe that god produced us all through manifestations and that we are all connected with him because of that. They believe that these emanations can be divided into 10 (astrology influenced) spectral worlds from which they can map 22 paths of spiritual light which they have mapped out into a branching tree form, which they call the ‘tree of life’ and each path of light can hold the attributions of various beings such as Archangel Michael, the Roman Mercury God, The Egyptian god Thoth and finally they believe that this light can communicate/influence us through a tarot deck being 22 cards. They believe that this is God’s way of talking with them. However why is the occult involved? This is simply because they believe God is equally evil and that evil is a quality of God, therefore to get to know God one also has to get to know/communicate with the evil (Satan).\\nA Jewish Rabbi known as Maharal who was heavily involved in the Qabalah movement was reported to have been successful in finally creating a golem which he used to defend Prague against anti-Semitic and pogroms. Story goes that Jews were being slaughtered by the hundreds under the rule of Rudolf the second, but out of desperation this Rabbi was able to mould a life form out of clay and bring it to life by using some ancient forgotten Hebrew rituals and incantations. This clay man was scary to the Jews enemies because it could appear out of nowhere as if it was invisible. It was also able to bring other dead spirits back with it, further terrifying the Jews enemies.\\nIf this was the Golem the ‘black alchemists’ were to bring to life, they did not do their research very well. The golem was unable to do any evil bidding on the Sabbath and was deactivated by means of a chanted psalm or an implanted psalm being pulled from its body. Also four letters were written on its forehead and if one was to rub off the first letter the whole thing would fall back into a pile of rocks and clay. So by no means was the Golem ever considered to be invincible.\\nIn fact, eventually the Rabbi was forced to deactivate his own monster for good as he forgot to deactivate it before one Sabbath and it went on a murderous rampage killing the Jews as well. The Golems remains was then stored in the attic of the Genizah where very few people have been permitted to cast their look upon. Even to this very day the attic is heavily guarded and some wonder what secrets it really contains. Some rabbis who were privileged enough to venture into the attic claimed that they were completely terrified by what they saw, one stating that he did see a figure of a man wrapped up. No one has ever been able to say what exactly is in the attic if anything.\\nWhile the game never accurately portrays the same occult rituals that qabalah uses to communicate with the devil and various pagan gods, it DOES go out of its way to MIMIC such rituals and practices which one would seriously question if this was a healthy form of entertainment. Personally I don’t take the matter of the occult lightly as the occult has a tendency to attract some VERY UNSAVOURY characters along with the curious, and unfortunately it is the curious that often fall prey to such ones. Take for instance a local girl who used to live by me. One day she became curious and seriously looked into the occult befriending two members. In a very short amount of time due to her gullibility and naivety they were able to gain her trust and on her birthday they gave her the present of stabbing her to death. The occult is NOT a light hearted subject to be made fun of.\\nWhen you have a huge company like Jetdogs who are supposed to be all about family entertainment and casual gaming you wonder where their ethics lie at times, is it just with cheap thrills? OTT animation and just bringing in the ones and zeroes? Or are they determined to produce wholesome entertainment? I feel as empty now as the Golem.',\n",

The main protagonist isn't as chasimatic as the max payne of old, and the modern cutscene story telling is ruining what was the appeal of max payne. The Story has potential - just like the movie had. But both were equally poorly executed.\\nI'd recommend anyone who's heard of max payne to go buy the second max payne game. It's much much better. Great voice acting, great action. Saving at will. Unpredictable story line, and the most awesome narrative in any game I've tried. Some of the quotes from that game rival the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"As a fan of Arc System Works' previous Guilty Gear games, and also having watched\\n, I've long been meaning to give BlazBlue a shot. I'm a fairly casual fighting game player and mostly play Street Fighter, but I found BlazBlue easy to get into, and I love how uniquely each character plays. Ragna feels like a pretty standard melee character and is a good way to get used to how to the game works, but then you also get characters like Nu, who doesn't play like anything I've ever seen before, with a focus on ranged attacks without the use of complex inputs. The cast is a little smaller than I'd like, but this is unavoidable due to the age of the game; unfortunately we have yet to see any PC ports past the first game.\\nThe art and sound design are also top-notch, just as they were in Guilty Gear, though this game is considerably more modern and much prettier graphically than the even more aged Guilty Gear titles available on PC. Game runs well too, with a pretty steady 60 FPS even on my fairly weak machine. There's no online multiplayer, but for someone like me who tends to get walked all over online in fighting games by the people who play the game more seriously, that's fine by me. In addition to the arcade mode, which does have little clips of story here and there, there's also a full-fledged story mode that plays out like a visual novel and adds some content to help keep things from getting stale.\\nOverall BlazBlue is probably going to be my go-to fighting game going forward. It's not perfect, but I've been enjoying my time with it immensely (especially Noel's combos, my God). The only thing this game is missing as far as I'm concerned is\\nIf that song played every Bang fight, no, every fight, no, at all times, I would be a happy man.\\nEDIT: So I just realized that one of Bang's specials does actually change the battle music to that song for the rest of the match. Good enough. And here I was worried it wasn't in the game because it wasn't in the soundtrack files included alongside it.\",\n",

There are a lot of nods and nudges towards the classic Wolfenstein 3D in this game, and a lot of older shooter mechanics to take you back to a simpler time.  You are B.J. Blazkowicz, an all-American badass and professional Nazi-killer.  There's a lot of basci weapon-types to use to make Nazi-killin' occur.  Pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and even a laser-cannon later on.  They feel good and enemies are responsive to their effects, it's satisfying to blow a Nazi's head off, or blow them to chunks and red mist.  The enemies can be challenging, especially in larger numbers, and the Nazi robots, Uber soldiers and dog-creatures all pose unique threats, there's even a classic boss-battle here and there.  Don't expect realism, gritty war simulation or technical feats.  The game looks well enough, the story is fun anything but Shakespear. and the shooting action is as ridiculous and gory as you could ask for with an id property FPS.  I highly recommend it if you're a fan of the older games or like shooting up Nazis in general.\",\n",

The graphics are amazing, the courses very well designed and full of details, and in a good computer the game will look impressive. The 3 types of vehicles are very different and give a lot of variety to the game. A lot of characters from many Sega franchises can be used, and even exclusive like a TF2 team.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The visuals are kind of cute but the overall feel, feelings a series coming back to life...sort of.\\n==========\\nThe Good\\n==========\\n1. Command & Conquer Feel - If you grew up with the classic C&C then you will feel a bit a home...sorta. The game has the old RTS feel with no unit caps and going all out war on each other with super weapons. However it feels like it\\'s missing something but can\\'t quite put my finger on it.\\n2. Super Weapons - You have a few factions to play with but each has their own super weapon that will destroy pretty much any size army or base if fired properly. The cool feature to this is the fact if you build more of the super weapon structure it speeds up the cool timer allowing you to fire much sooner and sometimes a lot more powerful blasts. For example one faction has a \"ion cannon\" type weapon, if you fire with just 1 super weapon structure then the lazer is rather small and weak but if you build up to 4 or 8...it becomes a light from the heavens that you kind of feel sorry for anyone caught in it.\\n3. The music - Hell ya if you love the classic C&C music then you will enjoy these sound tracks\\n4. Unlocks - A another neat feature is the unlock system. Basically if you beat a mission\\'s bonus objectives you get special buildings and units unlocked as well as sometimes added to the mission start. For example if you beat the first mission and all it\\'s bonuses you get a structure pre-build on any future missions even replaying missions will have the structure appear. This goes with units so if you unlock a tank and 3 infantry through the bonus objectives then they will appear at the start of every mission making it a bit easier to hold your base from A.I rushes.\\n5. Cross Faction Play - This is a feature I love. So if you buy any 8-Bit armies game (Wizards, Army, Space) you can play that faction online which is rather a neat feature as it doesn\\'t seperate any of the communities but instead brings them together for some wacky all out war.\\n============\\nThe 50/50\\n============\\n1. Quick and easy - This can be a hit or miss. The missions are simple destroy the enemy which can be done rather quick. The bonus missions do help a bit but most times you find yourself just massing an army and attacking the enemy base. There is also no story to it besides a few briefs in text about what is going on but nothing that seems to caught my eye.\\n2. The Style - The graphics are a hit or miss for me. At times I find them cute and other times I find them rather hard to notice on the map.\\n3. Balancing - There is a bit of a balancing issue with regards to factions. Some factions seem more overpowered then others. For example I found the marines just stomps the Wizards and Army factions rather easily. Again this can be fixed with overtime patches so it doesn\\'t hurt that much and also you have some rather awesome hosts that police their games making sure overpowered factions are not put into play.\\n============\\nThe Bad\\n============\\n1. No story - I loved the C&C and other RTS games made by these developers as their stories always seemed interesting to me. For this however there is no story making the battles rather dull or just pointless. It would of been interesting if they added a story to it with cutscenes to help push the story forward. At the end of every mission you just get You Win shoved in your face.\\n2. A.I - The A.I seems a bit of a hit or miss for me. At times I found them in missions to be super aggressive pushing everything towards my base before I can even get a decent defense up with nukes raining down on me. Other times I find the A.I just wait until getting attacked before they dispatch something to attack me.  Another good example is one of the last missions you have to take out the enemy  base which can easily be done by just massing an airforce and flying it to the side of the map and then into the enemy base...it doesn\\'t try to counter the attack or intercept it with. Even their base building seem lacking as they just mainly rebuild destroyed structures and that\\'s it. I find them strong in smaller maps or where they have multiple bases to start vs large maps 1v1 it.\\n=============\\nOverall\\n=============\\nA fun RTS especially for those wanting quick missions and that old C&C feeling.',\n",

The slow down mechanic twists the FPS gameplay to be more strategy based, and it's glorious for it. The skill ceiling is high: being able to shoot a guy in the head, throw a gun, take over another body,  grab the same gun, and then shoot someone else in the head: it's a wonderful feeling. Not only does the game mess with mechanics, it messes with your head. The story is a good 4th wall breaking experience, and like to push your buttons: in the best of ways. Honestly, the mechanics are polished so much, and while the game could use more content, it's able to deliver here. It's just the price that will drive people away, and that's a hard sell for 25 bucks. From a shear enjoyment factor, this game is worth the price. But note: some will find it a hard sell at that price, and I can't hold it against those who'd pause on that premise. But never the less, it's one of the most unique experiences I've had in the last 2 years, and that's saying something.\",\n",

The music is also another plus for this game as its very unique and it sounds good. The game also has a narrator who gives you tips on what is going on.

       "  'text': 'Indie developers pride themselves on breaking our expectations of game mechanics by flat-out doing things differently. Sometimes it works, too. However, there are occasions when the function of design contribute to the value and purpose of the subject. Instructions are integrated with the level design and after several sessions I was able to make just the barest sense of them.\\nExperimental games have limited credence with me. Structure has its benefits, and so do clear instructions. Released in 2013 on the now thriving Indie scene available on Steam, Starseed Pilgrim is an exercise in minimalist presentation and resource management. In this game you are a ‘symphonic gardener’, but so help me I wasn’t able to determine what the tools were, much less how they functioned beyond movement and block removal/placement.\\nThe entire game is presented in a single screen with visual and audio indicators of your degree of success. Our nameless, 8-pixel tall caretaker is constantly pursued by an ink-black space that results in a reset of your garden when caught. A numeric counter of–your hearts, as it turns out–ticks down to zero over a fixed period of time, and your only hope is to grow more and collect them… I think.\\nLogic puzzles are a hobby of mine, but only when they make sense. Crazy, right? A legend of your inventory and their attributes would have improved my understanding greatly… not to mention more accurately phrased goals and consequences.\\nI have over the years enjoyed a few artistic interactive experiences in the past, and that’s usually all they are. If you’re feeling rebellious and anxious with mainstream, this is your bag – or, garden. For my entertainment, too much pruning of useful information took place here.\\nWhat’s fun: Discovery of unique mechanics is fascinating. Graphics and audio are refreshingly simple.\\nWhat’s not: Ironically, graphics and audio communicate function and mechanic far better than the handful of words that appear during play.\\nRecommendation: Know your mark before you buy. This is an information-sparse puzzler with perplexing logic. If this style of play interests you, it’s worth every bit the asking price.\\nThis review is featured with others at Thousandhour Gaming\\n.',\n",

I haven't played the add ons yet but i will once i finish the main story and those to will be great. so long story short its a great game and you should get it you wont be dissapointed :)\\nF.E.A.R. Extraction Point REVIEW\\nGreat game from start to finish. Isn't as much of a jumpy/thriller FPS as it is a psychological one. It's somewhat fast paced, but also builds up a sense of tension and horror.. as if a little dead girl is following you're every move. A must play!!\\nF.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate REVIEW\\nThis is an excellent addition to the FEAR franchise. If you enjoy FEAR, you will love this episode. I enjoyed this a bit more than Extraction point, I found the action much sharper, the few new weapons fun (the grenade launcher is a little lame though) and the storyline decent.\\nIt starts out sort of the usual FEAR pace and you might not get pulled in, but by a third of the way in, the pace picks up BIG time! Then it starts to get really really good. There are a couple of new spooky things, and a really awesome abandoned underground city/subway area. The last third is really excellent, with massive firefights, and fierce action compared to the original FEAR game.\\nIts too bad that so many people review games without ever playing them. Thats pretty pathetic in my humble opinion. And too many are done by 14 year old adolescents who just parrot others.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'RimWorld is a great rogue-lite/micromanagement town/colony game that, if you love weird, strange, sci-fi elements in a brutal, but customizable survival setting, will be quite of fun for a long while. The game is very adjustable to all levels and types of play, from hardcore permadeath types, to peaceful base-building-only games. The science fiction flare is present in a space western fashion, with weird, bizarre elements throughout that give you challenges to work through.\\nOn the plus side, it\\'s exciting to start somewhere new and explore, set up camp, and survive. On the other, it\\'s a little difficult moving once you\\'ve picked a location, so hopefully you get an interesting map the first time around. The combat is relatively simple, some information isn\\'t clear on things like range, damage, cover, etc., or time-consuming to find out. Often times your colonists will do really stupid things like throw a grenade at an enemy that\\'s point-blank to them, or doing work/using items you didn\\'t mean for them to use. You can restrict certain activities and items in your colony management, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if many found it confusing to do so, given the large number of menus and categories for everything.\\nCustomizing building is very nice and fun, altering your environment, learning your colonists\\' strengths and weaknesses to provide a good defense, and loot is all decently put in, but at the moment there are two bigger issues for me: one is that when you reach a certain point, you\\'re kind of \"done.\" Once you beat it, the replays seem very same-y, and I just get this feeling of \"I\\'ve done all this before, just on a different map.\" Your mileage will vary, based on how much you like to set up different kinds of bases with the same stuff. The other thing is just how grind-y it can get at some points. Leveling some skills can take absolutely forever if your colonist, by chance, isn\\'t \"into\" that skill, mining, healing, recruiting.. there\\'s a lot of waiting, and losing even just one colonist can spell doom for your town, but then again, that is part of the rogue-lite appeal at play. Lose, learn, and start over.\\nUpdates are moderately often, and seem to add a decent bit each go. It\\'s playable and polished and fun enough that I\\'d recommend it.',\n",

With poise \"working as intended\", stamina being seemingly infinite, and rolls having a abs-o-fu-ck-ing-lutely amount of i-frames I feel that the pvp aspects of this game will never reach the heights of Ds2\\'s pvp and with the linearity of the level design it will never have pve as good as Ds1\\'s or Demon\\'s. It is a wonderful game, but it doesn\\'t feel like a \"classic\", which sets it apart from the rest in the series, but not in a good way.

       "  'text': 'Okay here\\'s a more serious review on Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. So after hours of play and unlocking weapons and getting past the learning curve. This game is simply amazing. It\\'s so fun and addicting. The community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but what can you expect it is an online only game. Torn Banner continues to update the game with new things and bug fixes (they added new maps, weps, and fixed some bugs and other things in the update today). You really gotta learn how to block and then pull off attacks. Flanking is the best thing to do when the enemies are spamming archers. There\\'s four classes in Chivalry. Archer who has the long range bows, crossbows, and even javelins and other throwables if you need to get up close and personal, Man at Arms is a fast brutal enemy up close due to the fact he can attack insanely fast and get away fast, Vanguard is like the knight (which we will get to last) and the man ar arms. I guess you can say he has \"the best of both worlds\". He has 2 handed weapons and moves slow, but faster than the knight. His weapons due some serious damage. The Knight. I never really play as the night because I like to move fast, but this guy can take some deadly blows and deliver them hisself. He\\'s a slow moving guy. Really this game is insanely balanced. I highly recommend this game.',\n",

The art direction of this game is stunning ;\\n+ Challenging but fair at all times (I played on\\n). 4 difficulties to choose from, including a \"One Life\" mode for additional glory and suffering ;\\n+ Excellent gameplay ;\\n+ Controls are very responsive and grow more extensive as you progress through the game (via learning new skills and powers) while remaining accessible and a pleasure to use ;\\n+ Healthy amount of secrets that add to maintain a continuous sense of wonder and exploration ;\\n+ Soundtrack fits very well with every scenario and situation.\\n- Storyline is juvenile and somewhat boring ;\\n- Simple objectives.\\n_____________________________________\\nis the 2016, enhanced version of the 2015 hit 2D platform game Ori and the Blind Forest. A quick google search will tell you that there is virtually no reason, if reason at all to play the original release instead of the Definitive Edition, as the latter gives you more areas to explore, adds in some interesting mechanics, provides an easier difficulty setting for whom it may concern and offers players a plethora of artwork and extras to look at while keeping everything from the original game. If you happened to snatch the original game before the Definitive Edition came out, you also have access to the Definitive Edition.\\nComing into Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition I expected a challenging game with a beautiful presentation, great mechanics and a wonderful soundtrack. I found the game to be indeed challenging and balanced, one of the most beautiful games I\\'ve ever played, with its whimsical, magical scenarios and vivid colors, the mechanics to be addictive and very well executed and the soundtrack, albeit somewhat monotone, a great fit for the on-screen action. Throughout the game you gain ability points that you use on a skill tree in order to upgrade the existing skills and powers and gain acess to new ones. The skill tree itself doesn\\'t hold your attention for too long with unnecessary depth, while the changes made on it have a significant impact on how the game feels - pretty cool, as it adds a different type of strategic thinking to the game without compromising the core experience. The clever mechanics make controlling Ori a pleasure all around. I\\'ve never played a platform game with a character that feels so powerful and nimble. Backtracking in this game, when needed, is a little less painful due to how awesome it is to get around with the little guy.\\nTo point out a few negative aspects, which for one I find scant but existent, I wish the storyline was more appealing. I liked the characters and saw potential in the narrative at some points, but ultimately it never quite materialized for me. The way the game is narrated is interesting but juvenile at times, and the story itself never amounts to much. I\\'m not sure which target audience the developers had in mind, but telling from the story my best guess would be somewhere around the pre-teen console/PC gamers. Following upon that reasoning, with how challenging the game feels, I would like to have gone through more intricate sequences of events in the story. This is to say that the objectives are established by the game as if to keep the story as easy to perceive as possible, dumbing it down a bit in the process. Given how the game is so good on most aspects, I take this as a minor gripe and it didn\\'t detract significantly from my enjoyment of the game.\\nI managed to beat the game with about 90% completion clocking at about 13 hours, which is about as much time you should expect to sink into this game if you take it slow and explore while going through it. I highly recommend using a good controller to play this game, I used a XBOX360 wired controller and it was awesome. Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition is an amazing game, a game I would love to see my children play one day. I highly recommend it to all ages. A classic of its time.\\n8.5/10',\n",

I don\\'t feel engaged, or immersed into the game. I just feel like I\\'m going through the motions so that the story will progress.\\nStealth is very well done for the most part. The game is basically a mixture of Splinter Cell and Dishonored. You can use darkness the same way you would in Splinter Cell, where being in the shadows basically means you\\'re invisible. Alongside that is a small array of three Dishonored-like powers that you can use. Clones (basically these little goblin things you can control to make distractions), invisibility (yay... who doesn\\'t love invisibility in a ♥♥♥♥ing stealth game), and the equivalent of Eagle Vision, or Void Gaze in Dishonored. It basically just highlights important stuff for you.\\nThe story seems interesting enough, I suppose. At least the intro was anyway. Most of the characters are just generic guys that don\\'t really sound believable. And the main character just constantly uses all these stupid quips that sound out of place.\\nAnd then there\\'s the combat. The sole reason why I moved the game to my SSD. It\\'s ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. I wouldn\\'t even mind it that much if you could dip in and out of combat by escaping the enemy, but that doesn\\'t even work. Every time I\\'m spotted, I just reload ♥♥♥♥in\\' instantly because I know I\\'m already dead. The enemies have \"throwing knives\". Every single enemy has an infinite amount of them. Simply put, the moment you\\'re spotted, anyone who\\'s trying to attack you will start throwing knives at you if you\\'re out of range, or standing on an object or something. This wouldn\\'t be too bad if they weren\\'t ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttedly overpowered.\\nAbout 90% of the knives will hit you no matter what. The only other way to avoid them is to start doing a load of evasive manuevers, and sometimes, they don\\'t even work. I\\'m not a master of game design or anything, but I can tell you that a player, upon being spotted, shouldn\\'t just be held in place by a bunch of ♥♥♥♥os throwing knives at him with perfect accuracy. You can\\'t even move when you\\'re hit by these things. They completely negate all your momentum and you stop ♥♥♥♥ing dead on the spot, even in midair. There\\'s no \"dramatic escape\" when every second you get hit by a knife and lose all your momentum instantly.\\nCombat is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, stealth is a novelty, and the game really doesn\\'t engage you at all.\\nAlso, it\\'s got some kind of memory leak issue that causes the game to run ♥♥♥♥♥ier and ♥♥♥♥♥ier the longer you play it. With perfect consistency, the game will always be stuttering around 30 frames after 80 minutes of playing, and it only gets worse from there, stuttering between 5-25 frames over and over, making the game completely unplayable until you restart it. It\\'s kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥knowing that you\\'re on a timer as soon as you start the game and over time, the program is just killing itself from the inside.\\nThat\\'s about it, really.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Well, first things first, you shouln\\'t really take this review very seriously. This is my first real review, and I only played about 30 minutes in to the game. I know, I am going to be a bit harsh, but it get\\'s what it deserves.\\nThe graphics are absolute garbage, even at max everything. I have a pretty bulky laptop, so I could run it on all sorts of different settings. From high to low, the quality was the same. And to make it worse, once a small explosion occurs, my frame rate drops to 3 frames. That\\'s not a lot - at all. Back to the point, the game\\'s \"plot\" if you could call it that is trash. You spawn, knowing absolutely nothing about where you are, who you are, anything. The game just starts shouting random crap at you that you are unlikely to understand. The two different \\'modes\\' are wierd, just, the whole game is. The controls are wonky, because the game doesn\\'t bother explaining a single thing you to. So, from the short time I played, I still couldn\\'t close out of all of the windows that it brings up. They\\'re like ads that cover the entire screen and you can\\'t close them unless you take a survey to earn a $50 giftcard to McDonalds. Or, something along those lines. And finally, for those who thought it would be like the Fallouut series, you\\'re absolutely wrong. Sure, it starts in Hoover Dam, and it\\'s post-apotolyptic, but really? It\\'s like futuristic Runscape meets WoW and has a baby. That baby\\'s name is \"Fallen Earth\" Rate 3/10 on a good day. Sorry, but it\\'s a piece of garbage.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The developer was kind enough to give out a bunch of keys when this game launched on steam, and a good friend got me a key even though I had missed the giveaway by 15 minutes. I was very excited to feel all the nostalgia of my instagibbing days. The experience was satisfying and great.\\nIf you enjoy instagib (one hit kill) gameplay, boosting (shooting the ground to shoot yourself upwards), twitch shooting, and an intense, fast-paced FPS experience, then you will enjoy this game.\\nAs a disclaimer, I always try to avoid mentioning the price of a game if I feel that its mechanics make up for any monetary value, however, for the current price ($9.99), the game is more than a finished product for an early-access game. Believe me, you will get your money's worth for this price if you are looking for a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t instagib experience.\\nThe aesthetics are very good - the levels are nice and bright and colorful. You can customize everything from the color/type of your laser beam, to the type of explosions when you kill an opponent, to the color of your character model (and your opponents'). Personally, I prefer to have the environment in greyscale and the enemy in a bright, pop-out color (red). You can even change the color of your name in-game. When you shoot, it will leave a paintball-style mark in the color of your laser - by the end of the match, the area will look like a paintball battlefield. The music and sounds are very good, especially if you like electronic music.\\nThe controls are typical of a traditional FPS, however, you will need to get used to the instagib style if you are a newcomer - boosting (shooting the ground to propel yourself) and constantly moving is a necessity to survival. Being able to shoot from a far is also essential (you can play around with the FOV, however, I feel that the max setting is a bit disorienting). Be warned, the instagib community for most games is relentless and unforgiving, so don't be surprised or disheartened if you have a hard time getting kills. From the servers I've played, the community seems very friendly. There is no tutorial, and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with FPS games - in particular, with the instagib game mode.\\nGameplay is extremely fast-paced - you must constantly remain on the move. There are a variety of game modes, like deathmatch and team deathmatch. The online community is fairly small, but still decent - you might not always have a full server. Everyone dies with one hit, and you can shoot across the entire map. Staying mobile, timing your boost jumps, and maintaining battlefield awareness (this is where the high DPI players will get to flex their skills) is critical to doing well in this game.\\nOverall, the instagib game mode is represented very, very well in Ratz, and anyone interested in that style of FPS should definitely check this out.\\nRecommend!\\nCheers,\\nDJSF\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Saint\\'s Row: Gat Out of Hell is the newest installment of the Saint\\'s Row Franchise. It is a standalone expansion to Saint\\'s Row IV, and as such shares a lot of similarities with it, mainly the gameplay and superpowers.\\nLet\\'s get the obvious question out of the way: you do not need to have Saint\\'s Row IV installed to play, although Gat Out of Hell will automatically detect a Saint\\'s Row IV savefile on your system and import your custom Boss into the game for use in cutscenes.\\nThe story begins right where Saint\\'s Row IV leaves off. Having conquered Simulation 31 and taken down the Zin Empire, the Saints are now living aboard their \"borrowed\" spaceship which now houses the entirety of whats left of the human race.  We are introduced to Kinzie\\'s birthday party, where Matt is getting the Saints to try out a Quija Board. Spoilers aside, this does not go well and a portal straight to Hell opens up and drags the Boss in. Johnny Gat and Kinzie decide to go in after him.\\nWithout spoiling too much more, I will say that this game is still as fun to play as previous Saint\\'s Row titles. You can expect your fair share of awesome weapons, including many themed after the 7 Deadly Sins. My favorite of these are the Diamond Gun that literally shoots diamonds (Greed) and the recliner mounted with a chaingun and rocket launchers (Sloth).\\nThere is a brand-new map with plenty of the usual diversions and activites to participate in aside from the main story. Many of the activites from Saint\\'s Row IV return, but with their own Hellish flair. For example: Trailblazing is now Hellblazing, requiring you to fly through orbs and checkpoints to complete it. Rather than a traditional progression of missions, Gat out of Hell has players completing diversions and causing general chaos in an effort to raise the level of a meter called Satan’s Wrath. Once certain milestones are met on the meter, a cutscene is triggered. The game turns into a musical at times during these scenes, which may be quite enjoyable for some as they are played out in fully-voiced cutscenes with decent dance and lyrics.\\nSuperpowers return from IV, and they’re upgraded by collecting Soul Clusters that are scattered around hell. Most are returning powers (blast, stomp, aura) with some new elemental powers, but Summon is exclusive to Gat out of Hell. Depending on which variant you use, it allows you to recruit imps to your side, make towers explode out of the ground, or produce a giant demonic ally.\\nAll of this is fine and dandy, as the game is such a blast to play, but fans of the franchise may be disappointing in the omission of certain features that have long been established in the series. For one, since you play as either Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kinsington, you are pretty much stuck with the outfit they have by default. There are no clothing stores in hell. Also omitted was the ability to whip out a cell phone and have an ally deliver a vehicle to you. This isn\\'t too big of an issue, as you can at anytime sprout wings and fly wherever you need to go. Flying controls are pretty smooth, with upgrades allowing more refined control while in-flight. And finally, there are no \"home bases\" to upgrade or radio stations while driving, not even an option to import music from your PC to use in-game.\\nGat Out of Hell isn\\'t a long game, and as a standalone expansion I didn\\'t expect it to be. After about 2 hours of play my save completion percentage read a modest 45%. Gat Out of Hell delivers what you\\'d expect from the Saint\\'s Row franchise, just in a smaller package. Overall, it is worth shelling out the asking price of $19.99, especially if you are a long-time fan.',\n",

       "  'text': 'So you know how when Overwatch was first coming out with gameplay footage and info, it looked like it would be really fun and engaging? Like a more updated Tf2?\\nThen it came out, and people realized it was slow, relatively unfun to play, and based more around the incredibly overpowered ultimate abilities rather than the actual gunplay.\\nWell Lawbreakers takes that dynamic and flips it onto its head. Everything about this game is built from the ground up to be satisfying.\\nThe abilities of the characters make sense and are actually well integrated. Many characters can use abilities while firing their weapons, making the abilities feel more natural and less like poorly integrated side moves for specific situations.\\nNone of the abilities are unfun either. There\\'s no get out of jail free cards. No instant team wipe cc ults. No reflection, invisibility, or invincibility. In fact, nine times out of ten, the abilities are either movement based or damage based meaning the characters were built with the core gameplay values in mind. \"Movement and damage\"\\nThe game modes reflect this. Blitzball is the most fun, as it revolves around grabbing the morty ball and bringing it to the enemy teams base. Since there isn\\'t any character abilities that are blatantly unfair for this (Like an instant activated ghost form that allows players to move around without taking damage) this actually feels like a fun and intuitive mode.\\nThe antigrav combat feels very natural. (For most characters at least, some feel a little bit too floaty, like Wraith). And because the main objective is usually in an antigrave arena, it feels like there is some strategy to the characters that one should pick. Obviously the best characters for the grav fields are the ones with rifles that work at long range and the ones with solid movement abilities for the air. This means it\\'s gonna be Harrier, Enforcer, and Vanguard dominating the area with a good gunslinger picking out the straglers from the edges. This means that depending on the mode, and the objective, characters will get varied use. It\\'s pretty refreshing to see this kind of thing.\\nI do have a few issues with a couple of the things in the game.\\n-Battery and uplink are the practically the same game mode. We don\\'t need both.\\n-Battlemedic feels a little unfun when you\\'re trying to take down his shield. I mean it\\'s not egregious but I did notice that it was really strong. Maybe it\\'s fine though since the cooldown is 6 seconds and I only saw the heals thrown out once in a blue moon anyway.\\n-Juggernaut can wall off the Blitz goal on certain maps. This kind of thing worries me for the games future, since even though it is counterable, it\\'s the kind of strategy that might make juggernaut camping a staple of blitzball with little reprieve in the future.\\nAnyway that\\'s my review. I love this game. Buy it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Metro: Last Light is pretty cool, I guess.\\nYou play as Artyom, a man who lives in the Moscow Metro because some jerks with big red buttons decided to push the big red buttons and kill us all.\\nDuring World War 3 in 2013, a war I apparently missed, it all got too hot and everyone decided to nuke everyone. Major cities across the world were burned away in nuclear hellfire and most of the human race was wiped out. Fortunately, 200,000 residents of Moscow managed to avoid being turned into the skeletons form Terminator 2 by hiding underground in the Moscow Metro station.\\nIt is now 2034, and the Metro has taken on a society of it\\'s own. Less than 50,000 people of the original 200,000 are alive in these Metro tunnels, but they have formed their own brand of society and go about their day to day lives working, exploring, farming, and of course, waging war.\\nBecause what screams post-apocalyptic Metro tunnels more than Nazis fighting Communists?\\nMetro: Last Light is a first person shooter where you, playing as Artyom, must travel through the Moscow Metro in search for the last Dark One, a survivor of a race of strange creatures that were wiped out in the last game.  But after being captured, Artyom is cut off from his faction, the Rangers of the Order, and has to travel through a hostile Metro while fighting Nazis, bandits, mutants, your mother, and several other enemies that want you dead.\\nMetro: Fast Food puts a big emphasis on resource management, ammo and supplies CAN be scarce within the metro tunnels if you\\'re a big stinky man who doesn\\'t know how to manage his things properly. Artyom is a very sneaky fellow, and usually has the advantage of not being seen when he goes into a new area. As long as you stay out of sight and avoid light sources, the enemy shouldn\\'t be able to see you, allowing you to plan out your attacks and pick off stragglers and loners as you see fit. Or you can just avoid them all together and stock everything like the hermit you are.\\nThe game gives you a lot of options for handling enemies and dangerous situations. Not only are all of the weapons weighty and crunchy to fire, but you also have a knife that lets you dispatch enemies quietly as well as throwing knives for when you want to do your best ninja impression. Not only that but you can carry three firearms at any given time and customize them to meet most situations. A silencer for when you want to be sneaky, IR scopes so you can see in the dark better, and even a suppressor for your shotgun because \\'No Country For old Men\\' was a rad movie.\\nYou also have two types of ammunition, or at least two types of ammo for weapons that can fire Soviet 5.45x39mm cartridges. See, I did my research.\\nThese \"golden bullets\" have become a currency in the Metro tunnel. The way it\\'s explained is that the bullets aren\\'t backed by any kind of currency standard like the NCR money was in Fallout, but instead they\\'re prized for their stopping power and penetration. So you have a choice to make, hold on to these bullets and spend them as currency, or use them in your gun if for any reason you feel as though the shoddy and poorly made dirty rounds that are manufactured in the metro just wont cut it.\\nThe game is linear, but honestly, what do you expect when you\\'re walking through a literal metro tunnel. The game does open up and allow you a bit of freedom when you enter stations with enemy encounters. But for the most part, you\\'re on the rails, no pun intended. It\\'s not a bad way for the game, considering how narrative heavy it actually is, and I never really felt all that oppressed when going through it, there\\'s still enough room to scavenge and hunt for supplies in between sneaking and fire fights, which is more than you can say for most linear games.\\nBut should you play Metro: cockfight?\\nThe game\\'s linearity may ward you off, and the mutant fights feel like nothing more than events that happen only to drain your resources. The boss fights are fairly boring, but they only happen twice or so throughout the entire game.\\nI would say Metro works as a nice gateway for people into the Eastern European Post Apocalyptic genre. It shares many similarities with another series of the same genre known as STALKER, who both borrow heavily from  Arkady and Boris Strugatsky 1971 classic novel: Roadside Picnic. It\\'s a very different take on the genre than you might be use to. There\\'s this overlying feeling of...I don\\'t know, hope I guess. There are crazies and freaks in the Metro, but it\\'s not like raiders and bandits completely outnumber and overwhelm the decent folk like the modern Fallout games, and it\\'s not like Mad Max where everyone is living off borrowed time and outside of things like ghosts and mutants, it feels more grounded in reality.\\nThe people aren\\'t living off borrowed time, they picked up where they left off and struggle to make with what they can. Don\\'t get me wrong, living in the Metro tunnels would still be a terrible and dreadful experience, but if you held on, if you struggled and fought with everyone else, you can make a life for yourself in those dark, old tunnels. And even though you might never see it, maybe, just maybe, your children, or your children\\'s children can stand on the surface world without radiation suits and gas masks, and can build a new world from the ruins of the old one. Maybe there is a light at the end of that tunnel...\\nHoly♥♥♥♥♥♥ that was beautiful, did I really write that?\\nMetro: Last Light gets 8 rat kebabs out of 10.\\nI don\\'t know, I think the Metro shrimps would actually taste good.\\nThe curator:\\nEDIT: Actually, nevermind, the more I think about this game the more I like it.\\nMetro: Last Light gets 9 rat kebabs out of 10.',\n",

(Trust me)\\n-Active and fair economy\\nCons:\\n-Weird UI issues which can cause quest issues.\\n-Long que times (Depending on certain factors)\\n-Quests can be grindy\\n-PvP can be and is a mess at times. (1v1 is great though)\\n-Tutorials are hit and miss\\n-Abilites cap out at level 24. (Meaning the rest is skill/ability points) This is a persoanl gripe.\\nJust expect a wildly different combat system. Something more the along the lines of Guild Wars 2 but way more directional based.(No ability is auto aimed for you) Like I mentioned in the last con, abilites cap out at 24. Which makes the last 26 levels purely focusing on your build. That is fine as the game wants you to master your class mechanics before you hit 50. However, the lack of new abilites takes away from the overall excitement of finding that next cool new ability while leveling.\\nIn all Wildstar is a game that is far underrated. It's fun, over the top, and easy to play.\\nIs it perfect? No, Is it fun? Hell yes. Does it re-invent the wheel? No. Does it do things unique and in its own style. Yes.\\nUltimately you have nothing to lose. The micro-transactions are there but is COMPLETELY optional. No game feature is held back. Only enhanced by the store.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Year Walk is based on Swedish lore about vision quests. You embark on a long walk in the woods, looking for signs and meanings, and you come across some very strange stuff. There's a very dreamlike quality to the game where the odd glyph or ghost you run into feels almost expected, but it also serves to take you out of the real world and immerse you with very simple, beautiful graphics. This makes the horrifying bits all the more effective, because they come in rough contrast to the feel of the rest of the game. I won't lie, there have been a few jump scares, but the feel earned instead of cheap. It's like a nightmare intruding on the edges of a pastoral dream.\\nGameplay is simple, moving left or right through pretty landscapes, moving forward or backward to different areas, and clicking on things to interact. You have a useful map and an encyclopedia that helps flesh out the legends and signs you encounter. The game also has a very clever way of getting you to use the encyclopedia later on, which I found very effective. The puzzles are pretty simple as well, so don't go in expecting a lot of gameplay. It's mostly exploring the woods and delving into the myths you encounter, which for the price, I think is well worth it. An entertaining, chilling experience.\",\n",

Castle of Illusion just has something about it.. perhaps it's the fantastic feeling controls that don't try to fight me at every turn, perhaps it's just the little kid inside me enjoying the refreshing innocence, or perhaps it's just the magic of Disney, but I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone of any age.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'In the long line of Sid Meier sticking his name into game titles comes \"Sid Meier\\'s Starships,\" a hexigrid turn based galactic strategy in the vein of Civilization. The twist here is there are planets to join your galactic federation and turn based starship battles with your armada against an opponents.  Building your armada and competing in battles is by far the most fun of the game. I\\'d say it is the real game and everything else is just fluff. You can buy vessels, then upgrade engines, shields, armor, lasers, cannons, torpedoes, scanners, stealth and fighters.\\nThe world is never enough and the universe is yours to conquer, purify or unify. There are several victory states such as domination, population, building wonders or scoring the top tier of a few science fields. While its nice to have all these ways to win, it feels like the game is geared toward conquering the galaxy. There\\'s an entire space battle system in place and its silly to overlook it and play diplomatic. The only real way to ensure that I\\'ll have a science or wonder victory is to make that the only type of victory allowed.\\nBattles take place on a hexigrid map, which in a way is illogical since space has a Z axis, but whatever. You can make use of heavy asteroids, planets and moons as cover. In a way its laughable that planets are as wide as four vessels. Smaller asteroids give less cover, but you\\'re still prone to attack, but take less damage.\\nIf a vessel is hiding behind cover, you can fire a limited amount of torpedoes that will breach cover. The only catch is you need to detonate the torpedo one turn later, so that gives your foes a chance to move. You get to see your torpedo fly and then push the button to make it explode. Its a great dynamic to have. Even when I\\'m out of range, I\\'m firing torpedoes just to do something. Torpedoes are limited to the number you have upgraded on that star ship.\\nEach ship gets a turn with a movement and an action in either order. During an action it depends what the vessel has upgraded. You can attack, impulse an extra move space, cloak hide, scan for cloaked vessels and release ships. If you chose to move, you can attack as you move you move between two cover points, but I never felt a need to get that complicated. Releasing ships adds a small cluster of fighters with long range movement, little health and no shields.\\nVessels have shields, so if your weapon\\'s attack power is less than the shield, its ineffective. Once shields are down, then you can do some big damage. The armor rating amounts to hit points. The more upgrades you have to a ship, the slower it moves, so you\\'ll need to upgrade engines. Then there\\'s stealth that conceals a ship unless an enemy is near it and upgraded scanners will compensate for finding stealth enemies. Its a good dichotomy.\\nOther notable features on a map include anomalies that when you fly into them, you appear out of a different one. Its good for speeding things along if there\\'s one ship left, but your comrades are across the map. Even if you pop out in a random location, its still closer and a chance to flank enemies.\\nBattles have a victory condition, a map condition and a card. Most of the time you earn victory by annihilating the opposition. Other times its defend an outpost, escort a vessel to an outpost, guard warp gates, destroy a single vessel or get a ship of yours into a warp gate. The maps feel generated and the map conditions are things like enemy torpedoes are undetectable, more asteroids, less asteroids, shields are less effective. It adds some diversity to the battles. Then there are the cards which feel forgotten about. You get one or so cards during each battle and its a gamble when you use them. I wish I could say more, but in seven hours of playing, I never made use of them beyond a curiosity.\\nThe idea of the game is that your entire armada flies from planet to planet. After these battles win or lose, you keep all your ships, but you need to repair them for the damage that they\\'ve taken. So a major loss requires you to repair everything. Well if your armada wrecks the armada of a competitor that leaves that same competitor open for more attacks on the same turn. Blood thirsty players like myself will keep pushing through, but to prevent the entire universal conquest on a single turn, your crew\\'s efficiency goes down with each battle. Once its as low as it gets, you\\'re forced to take a shore leave and end your turn.\\nLike a lot of these hexigrid games, you\\'re competing and aligning with other competitors. You start the game by visiting planets, gaining their support which seems rather easy. Just win a battle and you\\'re halfway there! Take a shore leave on a planet that you have 50% devotion with and you can gain an extra 25%. Some planets end up contested where four competitors can have a stake in it.\\nOnce you\\'ve taken quarter of a planet you can spend food to plant cities; I\\'m sure that\\'s how it works. Cities increase workers I guess. I was never too sure. The game just told me to build cities, so I did.\\nFrom there there are upgrades to a planet. Upgrades cost metal and give you more resources across various types that never felt of any consequence. Other planet upgrades include planetary defense craft, giving you a home field advantage with an extra vessel if an enemy ever attacks. Constructing a warp gate can bring your fleet to a planet under attack.\\nSpend science points on technology upgrades that will boost armada stats by 25% of a single category. Plenty of planets will reward you with a technology of your choosing. Even if you are about to enter a battle with someone, you can negotiate and they will give you technology or food to leave the planet. If you agree, that\\'s some sort of a peace treaty right there. Other times if you have a 95% chance of winning, the game lets you have the planet without a fight.\\nIt feels like I managed the bare minimum of micromanagement and got away with it. Rather than clicking on each planet to build this or that, I just clicked on one and upgraded until I was broke. There is an information icon to click on that will advise you what you should do, but it should just be on the screen without me having to click something. Perhaps a hide button would be better for players that want to play it their own way. Even with no guide and little to no tutorials I still managed to get through it.\\nWhen you start a new game, you select map size, up to six opponents, difficulty and victories. Enormous still felt small, but I suppose on normal took me four hours to conquer the galaxy while easy took only three. Easy mode is laughable. My first time playing, none of my vessels were ever damaged, let alone destroyed. Its a good way to get your feet wet, but about an hour in, there was no challenge. Normal felt like a good challenge, but there are still two difficulties.\\nYou have a selection between twenty-four characters, eight within each of the three motivations for supremacy, harmony and purity. Each one has their own stat boost. One character has a 25% better this or that. Sometimes less cost, other times more of whatever. Some start with an extra vessel.\\nI feel less stress and more joy playing this game than I do with Civilization games. Those other games feel like there\\'s always a cold war and you need to prepare before the invaders come, while I feel like here I have my destiny in my own hands. I\\'m smart enough to win battles even when the game tells me that I have a 25% chance of winning. Its also a small game. When other publisher and developer are 4 GB large, this one fits on a CD at 650 MB. Must be all that blank space rather than terrain.',\n",

But if you are not then you should look for another platformer.\\nI didn't had any troubles with this game. I love platform games so it was kind of must play for me. It's not short, have few great moments and funny monster finishers. Hell Yeah! is packed with beatiful colors and tons of blood. Sometimes you feel overwhelmed with designs of maps but quick look at map solve everything. Besides a game there is also island where beaten bosses work for your. I like this idea but to be honest, I went there once or twice... only because there is achievement for doing it. Too bad it's just a game for one time.  I don't think so after beating and unlocking everything I will ever back to it. There is also DLC for more missions but I'm not sure if it's worth getting. I wish that Steam had a something more than just a positive/negative review system, because I can't recommend it for everyone, and also I can't say it's a bad game... So like I said earlier: Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is for platformer games fans only. I doubt anyone else will enjoy it in 100%.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'First off, a small disclaimer; like many LOTRO players, I migrated to Steam after having played for many years before, so I have many many more hours in game than my Steam activity indicates.\\nLord of the Rings Online is a truly impressive diamond in the rough, when it comes to traditional \"themepark\" MMOs. The gameplay, while standard, is solid and does exactly what it needs to. Some classes are a bit slower and simpler than others. For instance, Guardian is a dead simple sword&board tank for the most part, while a warden is much more complicated hybrid. Different classes cater to different playstyles, and that is a good thing.  In terms of functionality, they are very well balanced; all classes are perfectly viable for their given party roles as well as solo play. It probably helps that there is very little in terms of PvP (which may be a big drawback for some), so the devs don\\'t have be delicate with balancing.\\nWithout a doubt, LOTRO\\'s biggest pro is it\\'s world. The world is MASSIVE and truly detailed. There are bonafide Tolkien scholars on staff at Standing Stones, and it really shows (to clarify, Standing Stones is the current developer, but really they are basically the same core team that have been working on the game for years. They have just finally moved out from under the heel of Turbine and have been able to move the game forward ever since). The various stories of Middle-Earth, the limited voice acting, and the score are really well done and make the world feel very vibrant.\\nSo, the game itself is definitely worth playing, but what about the payment model? Yes, this game is F2P, and there is a LOT of content given for free. However, note that once you get to a certain point, you do have to either be a subscriber or purchase what\\'s called a \"quest pack\" in order to complete various stories and side quests, however the Book quests (think, \"Main Story\" quests) are free for the most part. There\\'s also a lot of instanced content that can only be completed if you have purchased unlocks from the cash store, or are a subscriber (basically if you are a subscriber, there is almost nothing that is limited). So, the payment model is a bit of a mixed bag. Putting content behind paywalls is always a bit problematic, but you still get quite a lot of content for free and can eliminate most immediate limits with a relatively small amount of cash (think a few dollars for a quest pack for an entire region, which can give you several hours of playtime if you work on completing them all).  In my opinion, the game is well worth paying for and a much better experience overall if you do. Give it a try; even as F2P the game is worth playing and trying, you really have nothing to lose. If you are a Tolkien fan, you will find a LOT to love here.\\nFinally, a note on the community: LOTRO has, without a doubt, one of the nicest communities of any MMO on the market, past or present. There are many active players who seek to engage their fellow players with Tolkien-lore friendly events, and every year the devs encourage a large amount of participation in the Child\\'s Play charity.  Veteran players are by and large, very helpful and encouraging to new players, so don\\'t let the game\\'s size and long history deter you from getting into it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Cool little experiment of a game!\\nMissing Translation has 2 aspects to it, essentially:\\nFirst,  puzzles. 75 puzzles, 25 of each type. The first set is pure graph theory. Essentially, you need to choose a path to clear all the dots without crossing the same one twice.\\nThe second set is about trying to fit various pieces into place, but as you move one, the other moves as well. So you\\'re trying to lock them in place until you can move all 2-3 into their proper places.\\nThe third set is like rotating domino. Each piece has 4 sides that can be 1 of 2 colors. You rotate pieces until each side is paired with a side of the same color.\\nAs far as a puzzle game goes, this isn\\'t too good. It\\'s not awful either, but the puzzles are, for the most part, too easy. The first set was nice and some of the later puzzles weren\\'t immediately solved (took 30 seconds to a minute, maybe? so they\\'re still pretty easy, but not brainless). The third set, however, was very, very easy. Mostly because each puzzle had tons of solutions, so you just had to align the pieces that were out of place and everything pretty much worked without much thought.\\nOverall, these puzzles seem to be mostly filler. They didn\\'t seem to serve a purpose of guide you into more and more difficult puzzles.\\nThe other part, is trying to solve the language of the game. It\\'s a bit too much like Fez, unfortunately, so it didn\\'t seem as impactful and it may have otherwise been?\\nThere\\'s a very simple numbering system, and another emoticon system. Though the symbols themselves don\\'t have an obvious meaning, you\\'ll find a room in the game that will clear the meaning for you, if you pay attention to the clues throughout the game.\\nThe numbering system was... okay. One part made sense; spoilers:\\nThe emoticon system was pretty cool, if a little strange to figure out. And, once again, was mostly meaningless. It was never used in the game itself. Just a very very tiny bit of backstory or flavour, I guess. Which is okay, since it\\'s a free game.\\nTwo last things: though the graphics were mostly \"meh\", I really liked the intricated patterns on the puzzle tiles and some other parts of the game. They look cool.\\nThe music was also fairly enjoyable, though nothing to write home about.\\nThis game does try to do some things a little differently, and it gets a mild recommendation for that.

And that's not to say the sequel is bad, it's not, both of them are fantastic games.\\nStill, I don't know if it's worth buying the first game anymore. There's a 'Left 4 Dead 1 coop' mutation for L4D2 that literally just makes the game play just like the first one. On top of this, all of the campaigns have been officially ported over by Valve themselves, so... I guess if you REALLY BADLY want that PURITY of Left 4 Dead 1, you might consider buying this, but otherwise just grab the second game.\\nThat said, they changed some things with weapons around in the second game, most notably I don't think you actually have to count your shotgun rounds off if you're using the XM1014, because the reload is always the same speed. And the addition of 'more guns' is nice, but again, you only need the five or so weapons that L4D1 offers. You have your M16, your XM1014, Uzi, pump shotgun. That's really all you need. Anything more just 'bloats' the game, in a way.\\nSometimes, less is more.\\nEither way, I can't possibly not recommend this game, because, come on, it's Left 4 Dead, the sceond game releasing didn't MAGICALLY warp time and space and cause the first game to be bad.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Disclaimer~ I have played this more on the PS3 version of game\\nI\\'ve heard so many negative things about this game. This is odd, because the reviews are very positive on the Steam page. The negativity seems to be very similar to what Duke Nukem Forever struggled with. Players that remember the previous titles wanted a specific experience the new one didn\\'t deliver on. Like Duke Nukem Forever, this game isn\\'t actually that bad as long you judge it for itself rather than the others.\\nI have not played the previous title of Earth Defense Force. I can only say that my experience with this title was simply positive. Do I think this is the best thing since gravy? No. I will say this was a better Starship Troopers game than the actual Starship Troopers game.\\nThe gameplay is okay. It\\'s not too slow, it feels like it\\'s actiony enough for it to be arguably be considered fast paced. While it is fun at first, I will say that the weapons you start with get very dull after awhile. All the enemies you fight, they have a lot of health. This causes you to resent yourself for choosing any of the fully automatic weapons later in the game. The solution is to have slower rate of fire weapons or missile based weapons.\\nIt gets more tedious, however, when you start unlocking the good weapons that hit the targets for you by heat seeking them. You could literally aim at the sky and the missiles will figure out the rest for you. This basically means that you don\\'t even have to play the game anymore to play the game.\\nThis is sad, because I feel it could be very gun to combat against enemies with a variety of firepower instead of feeling I have to use specific type of weapons. I cannot help but feel a simple solution would be to just make each weapon have different strengths and weaknesses rather than just saying \"these are the best weapons, you unlock them later.\"\\nThe player can also pick classes of soldier, which is an interesting touch. There is one with a jetpack, another that\\'s compensating speed for other perks, etc. You can pick based on your playstyle. Downside when playing online? The fastest player gets all the kills and all the tanks sorta just show up late to the party, thus you can argue you\\'re being punished for picking the armor class soldier. Though, not as punishing as being the one guy that picks a cannon based weapon while the other players spam rockets into the sky and hits everything in the area.\\nThe enemy diversity isn\\'t drastically huge, it\\'s pretty limited. It isn\\'t so small that you will get bored right away, but it does tarnish replay value. That\\'s the same with the actual missions, they\\'re all the same. The game just doesn\\'t feel interesting as far as goals or purpose. You sorta just play to kill.\\nOnline has some expected choices, such as survival. It\\'s okay, it\\'s not super enjoyable because of the weapons once again as earlier mentioned. The main attraction is just coop for the main game, the \"story\" I guess we\\'ll call it.\\nOverall, it\\'s a positive experience. It\\'s an okay game, kinda like how some B-Movies are an okay movie. You might not play that movie a whole lot, you\\'ll watch it every time and again. This game? I beaten it on PS3 for single player and never touched it since. I have a hard time wanting to play it on PC. I do think $10 is worth it, but maybe even wait for a sale.\\n6/10\\nPros-\\nCheap game, good experience\\nGameplay is pretty fun and exciting at first.\\nSome variety of player customization, such as weapons and character class\\nYou fight giant bugs\\nYou get what you paid for.\\nCons-\\nReplay value is low\\nGameplay is pretty lacking for the long term, it\\'s like a firework. Exciting at first, then you realized you\\'ve spent some money on something for very temporary satisfaction that could have gone elsewhere.\\nThe game feels lacking and empty as far as content goes, even though I cannot figure out as to why.\\nSome weapons are poorly balanced, some are easily spammed and take any skill out of the game, thus all the satisfaction of playing. Ruins the game for other players as well that don\\'t get to kill anything because of their power.\\n6/10. A positive experience. Not a bad game, but not great.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Jazzpunk is a game that you won\\'t know if you like it unless you experience it for yourself. As much as I enjoy these walking simulator games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and The Stanley Parable, Jazzpunk does not meet the quality you expect from these games by its narrative, immersion nor in its writing (especially its humor).\\nI wouldn\\'t recommend this game as the intro screen and various moments in the game have tons of flashing lights.\\nComedy is not something I\\'m going to critique the game for. It\\'s too subjective, but I think I know who it\\'s audience. This game comes across as another Youtube Bait game (Goat Simulator, etc.). The humor only seems to work off of \"LOL RANDOM NONSENSE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?\", which makes the game itself feel shallow to play alone.\\nThe game is chalk full of random mini-games, techy/nerdy/video-game references, and tons of open environments with various gags to be found. If you explore everything and exhaust all the dialogue, you\\'ll probably get five decent hours of a playthrough.\\nBut with so many unnecessary nonsense gags, you might grow tired from the game\\'s charm after the first area. And don\\'t expect getting a narrative worth those five hours (at best).\\nThere\\'s nothing for me to analyze in its mechanics nor anything story-wise to keep me interested in reviewing Jazzpunk.\\nI liked the aesthetic, the soundtrack and the spy-hero gags/moments of the game. I wanted more of the riddiculous espionage humor, but that gets burried amongst the LOL moments that I quickly grew bored of.\\nSome people may enjoy the more obscure references and the novelty of Jazzpunk.\\nI sure don\\'t see the appeal of a game of easter eggs. What\\'s the surprise if you know that is the gag?',\n",

       "  'text': \"This game is a good example about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port on PC of a good game can become a burden in your gaming experience. Framerate drops, massive resource use, crashes (at every first launch 1-2 random crashes) all the time. Ridiculously evil major bugs, like mission items disappearing from active map to out of it causing instant level restart or no  possibility to continue main story for some kind of save game crash. All of it was driving me into despair.. So the good part, chmm.. There are some! The best thing in this game is vast opportunity to build unimaginably various zombie killing tools, oh God Almighty, from already ordinary♥♥♥♥♥♥♥guns to bulldozer type motorcycles or dynamite chairs. Massive zombie hordes, which you can kill in every way you can imagine, is another part of that deal. As advantage I also see possibility to have a good co-op fun match uniting your zombie killing might with your friend. Only these things dragged me till the end of story all that time, although I was blaming myself for this misery every ♥♥♥♥ing minute. In conclusion I can sadly say, that this game is just wasted opportunity to make proper port from console. I don't recommend to play this game on PC, maybe console version is different story, but if there are no essential bugs like on PC version and you are able play it calmly...\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-style isometric dungeon crawler in which you play an unlikely hero with unlikely abilities on a quest to defeat the evil Lord Dredmor for some reason or whatever. This game features many of the same systems found in turn-based rogues such as Dungeon Crawl, IVAN, or Cataclysm DDA.\\nThe main difference between DoD and those previous games is that your character does not have a set class, rather you simply pick an assortment of skill trees (up to 7) and those define what kind of character you will play. Because there is no “class-lock” this means you can play a wizard that specializes in melee combat or a rogue magician, though you will find that some skills tend to synergize better than others. Additionally, melee-heavy builds, while successful early on in the game, will start to struggle later on when you start to encounter enemies that can corrupt your weapons on touch and swarms of spell-casters. Basically, you need to find the right mix of attack, defense, and crowd control. The latter is especially important because on each level there is a monster zoo a.k.a. a room completely flooded with monsters that will quickly overwhelm the unprepared player.\\nIf you happen to have the Conquest of the Wizardlands DLC, you may opt for trying out crafting systems in this game by utilizing the wizard portal device to store all your ingredients. Without it, crafting is likely infeasible as your inventory will constantly be full from all your dungeoneering. I found crafting to be most useful for creating projectiles and helpful potions, as there are plenty of materials to be found for both.\\nAll in all, Dungeons of Dredmor is a solid rogue entry that serves up a more polished interface than simple tiles or ascii characters. True, the logging system could be a bit larger, and the game does tend to lag from time to time (be careful not to click too much/press too many keys or you will waste turns) yet the game provides a decent challenge to any player willing to brave it, granted they have the patience and determination to conquer all 10 (or 15 DLC) levels and slay Lord Dredmor.',\n",

I streamed this game for four hours straight and within an hour I was desperate to quit. The entire game is nothing but a bland third person shooter, you literally hold W + Mouse1 for the whole game.\\nMost enemies are nothing but bullet sponges which makes sense in the Warhammer universe but from a game design point of view its horrendously boring. Even boss battles are just \"shoot it until it dies\". Cutscenes are minimal, the dialogue is garbage and the plot is painfully basic, you have access to the Warhammer 40k universe and the plot is kill the Orks on a Forge World.\\nEventually the forces of Chaos emerge but the gameplay doesn\\'t change, at all! The Chaos forces literally felt like bigger bullet sponges and the Daemons are just re-skinned melee enemies, who are also bullet sponges!\\nOverall this has been a legitimately painful experince and I wouldn\\'t recommend this game to ANYONE. Even if you like Call of Duty you won\\'t like this because most enemies are bullet sponges, if you die you have to do the entire segment all over again and kill every bullet sponge AGAIN.',\n",

       "  'text': 'As an enormous fan of the previous games, I was both delighted and disappointed. On the one hand, it\\'s Max f\\'ing Payne, and he\\'s just as much the tormented hero as ever. He\\'s even more of a mess than before this time, with an opening cutscene in which he downs an entire bottle of whiskey, some painkillers, smokes what seems to be a whole package of cigarettes, and eventually just cries on the floor, all the while narrating how much of a human wreck he is. It\\'s perfect.\\nOn the other hand, it\\'s quickly evident that this one wasn\\'t made by the original developers, with the uniquely quirky style mostly absent and replaced by a very Grand Theft Auto-esque storyline set in a whole new location. I\\'m all for a series taking a risk on a very different setting, but the new surroundings make things so much less personal for Max, with no one from his past coming back to haunt him, and nothing left to lose. It\\'s still a pretty good story, and Max is as entertaining as ever to watch grump and scowl his way through things, but it feels less like \"Max Payne 3\" and more like \"The Adventures of Max Payne: Bullets Over Brazil\" or something.\\nThe brief flashback chapters give a glimpse of what could have been, really nailing the feel and grittiness of the first two games, and it makes me wish they had just kept the game set there and let it actually be a final, conclusive character arc that ties up all the previous loose ends rather than giving us this exotic adventure that feels more like a diversion than anything. The writing and acting are good, if a little off-tone with the previous games, and Max is still one of my favourite video game protagonists ever, so I was pleased to see this one see the light of day, but it\\'s very much a Rockstar interpretation of the series that doesn\\'t strike the same chord with me the first two did.\\nBut aside from storytelling shortcomings, this is also just a really damn good shooter. Sure, it\\'s repetitive, with the entire duration basically just being shooting dudes in the face in a variety of exotic settings, but the mechanics are incredibly smooth and the impacts are tremendous. Without taking control away from you, the shootouts really do end up looking like something straight out of a movie, with impressive brutality and a great attention to detail that really gives the gunplay a sense of impact and danger. There are no rpg elements, no upgrades, no quicktime events, this is just guns versus badguys, from start to finish.\\nIt\\'s also a fantastic port that ran like a dream on my modest rig, with some really impressive visuals. Definitely a plus.\\nThere\\'s multiplayer too. I didn\\'t bother to try it, as there doesn\\'t seem to be a playerbase of any sort. Meh. Don\\'t buy it for that, and avoid all the DLC associated with it.\\nOverall, while this might disappoint fans of the series, it\\'s still pretty awesome all on its own, and I consider it to be a greatly underrated piece of pure slow-motion diving shooty violence with an awesome soundtrack and impressive production values. Temper your expectations if you\\'re a Payne fanboy, but give it a shot if you enjoy singleplayer shooters and gritty action heroes.',\n",

But don't let any of this get in the way as you put yourself in the shoes of the time traveller Marty McFly.\\nOverall: I recommend, especially for those who were actually alive in the 80's and saw all 3 movies back when they were released in theatres (unlike me)\",\n",

So long as you used logic you can pretty much solve every puzzle.  This is a sharp change from other adventure games where just doing the most absurd thing possible ends up being the correct decision.  Also loved the art direction/graphical style.  Time was clearly spent on each set piece and it looks like a modern adventure game, not one of the hideious 3D type of styles that became popular near the end of the adventure game genre.  Despite all that though, this game is ridiculously short and the story is terrible.  I mean realllllllllllly terrible.  It starts off alright, but then just goes bananas.  I thoguht it was a murder mystery, but the killer is revealed literally in the first minute, and then things just get stupidly weird.  It might be the single worst story ever created.  It makes it really hard to recommend a game when the story is just garbage.  I only spent $2.50 on it, so i feel that was a good price, but still It's best to skip this one.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II is a 2d platformer developed by SEGA and released May 15, 2012. As with Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1, these games are basically a revisualization/reboot of the classic SEGA Genesis Sonic Games.\\nDr Robotnik /Eggman is back at it again, Sonic needs to go kick his robo-butt again\\n, This time you're joined with tails, and Robotnik has Metal Sonic.\\nYeah no, there's nothing else to say here, you've danced this dance. There's no voiced characters, just gestures and good old fashion 2D platforming. Some people will like it, others will hate it.\\nThe new thing brought to the table in this game is the addition of using Tails. He's basically going to be your Yoshi in this game, and just like in Sonic 3 he can be beat up with no real consequences.\\nYou can rebind the keys to what you want, but the default keys I used for the whole game were WASD for directional movement, and JKUI for the buttons... so J is jump, U is to use a tails power, and either K or I were to activate Super Sonic after collecting all 7 chaos emeralds.\\nI really liked to be able to use the tails team power to get out of Super Sonic mode, so that's nice... Originally you couldn't stop super sonic mode unless you died or ran out of rings.\\nBut I digress, Tails has two uses: If you're standing on the ground sonic and Tails will make a big spin-dash-wheel which can destroy objects in the way. And if Sonic is in the air, Tails will fly with him, btw hit J to go up, if you hit U again Sonic will let go of Tails.\\nAgain, This game has pretty much what I'd expect and want out of a Sonic Game. I got really discouraged and bosses and bonus stages, but I successfully beat the whole game, got all the chaos emeralds, and yeah... to most people that's the sign of a fully beat sonic game.\",\n",

Still pretty strong in terms of numbers. Premise is that Batman has left Gotham to groups of mad vigliantes out to rid the city of crime (Batz) dressed up in clothes like him, and criminals the (jokerz) are out to rid havoc.\\nPros: Good Selection of Weapons/Classes ranging from your typical shotguns, rifles, snipers to more elaborate ones like Bear Traps, Mr Freeze's Freeze Ray and even a Parrot Launcher. Pretty Well Balanced for Beginners.  Customisation is pretty good. lots of profile options, calling cards etc.   Gadgets are a nice alternative. Gliding, Springed shoes, roller blades, and jetpacks offer different ways of moving around maps.\\nCons: Limited number of maps (only 6). Tendency to glitch/lag an awful lot and being kicked for no apparent reason. Only 6 people per game.  Some of the DLC stuff is pretty over-priced.\\nLeveling is a mixed bag. Achievements can be reached by mixing around different weapons, set ups. Gun gameplays reacts fast enough, easy to pick up with exp of the genre. Only problem is it can take ages to build up a few decent custom load-outs, if you want a varied playstyle.\\nTeam Deathmatch is the best mode, the rest are just variations of capture the flag etc. TM is the only one still really busy.\",\n",

By 1997 we could only really have one game on the PC to play, and Total Annihilation spent alot of time on there. Coming from C&C and AoE TA just blew them out of the water, two lovingly crafted factions, totally unique units and such a wide array of units it had too! You were never locked down into a play style, you had the tools to do whatever you felt necessary. Maps were varied, from closed corridor battles to open ground which often changed from pristine wildernesses to a decimated hell hole throughout the course of the map.\\nThe amount of content here is vast, it's an old school campaign, so tons of missions with good scaling difficulty, piles of maps for skirmishing and top mods available. Not to mention a top soundtrack by Jeremy Soule (Elder Scrolls, KOTOR etc).\\nAnd for the pittance they're asking, this a steal.\",\n",

Nice Artstyle, nice music, and surprisingly good voice acting, especially for an indie game.\\nThis isn't a con, but it is somewhat short. Took me two hours or so to complete the game, and I did it all in one sitting. It felt like the right amount of time, honestly. It didn't overstay its welcome.\\nWhile this is most definitely a recommendation, there are three issues with the game I can think of having just beaten it.\\n- Framerate is all over the place. This is a weird one, since there shouldn't be framerate issues at all, but it fluctuates betweel 15 and 30 fps. Most of the time it's at 30, but sometimes during conversations it'll drop to 15 and it's kind of jarring.\\n- Having to click the walk icon every time you want to switch screens gets annoying\\n- I thought before or at the end I'd know who the killer was, but I honestly had no idea. There's a point at the end, no spoilers (intended, but still may be a small spoiler. So stop reading here if you don't want a sort-of-but-not-really spoiler!), where you need to select the right part of the map. How could anyone know to pick that area?

       "  'text': 'I don\\'t see what\\'s so great about Deus Ex.\\nTo get the game to run on modern PCs various mods are needed. Alt Tabing out of the game or using the steam overlay causes a spectacular crash either way. Without the relavant mods the game has absolutely attrocious framerate issues.\\nAs a shooter the game is esoteric; aiming has nothing to do with actually trying to hit the target, it\\'s determined by how long the player is willing to stand still doing nothing until the crosshairs decide to reach their smallest size allowing a projectile to land anywhere near the intended target; this, alongside the game\\'s awkward default controls leads me to think that this game wasn\\'t meant to be played using a mouse at all.\\nAs a stealth game Deus Ex is laughably bad, enemies can\\'t see the player even if he was standing directly in front of them as long as he was a sufficent distance from them. Don\\'t bother with the tranquilizer darts as enemies will spas out shooting at the player and running to the nearest alarm; which would be the exact oposite of tranquil. The only purpose it serves is being able to knock out Men In Black to take their ammunition as a opposed to them exploding for no reason after death.\\nAs an RPG the game holds very little options at all. What I do admire is that the game doesn\\'t award skill points for killing enemies, which encourages going for the quiet approach. Skill points can be spent on the game\\'s various skills, which include such wonderous options like Swimming. Honestly there\\'s very little reason to spend points on any skill past rank 2 aside to fix the god-awful accuracy of all the guns in the game by leveling a weapon skill, since leveling lockpicking or engineering will see the player rarely ever run out of lockpicks or multitools. Yes, that\\'s run out of, as in, it doesn\\'t actually improve the player\\'s ability; in the words of Spaceballs: \"Even in the future nothing works!\" since absolutely everything you use, lockpicks, multitools, armor, invisibility, will break and vanish after using it once and their relavant skills determine how long you can actually use it after activating it or determine the percentage a lockpick or multitool will knock off the lock.\\nThe game has a focus on Augmentation, to get them the player must gather augmentation canisters and upgrades. Each canister has two options for the player to implant, and the choice is permanent. Really the only useful ones are Regeneration(medkits and the medicine skill became close to useless after that), Speed(the levels are way too large and way too empty to take things slowly), and Power Regulation, as everything else is too wildly situational and expensive in bioenergy to be useful, even when I did use other augmentations they seems to have absolutely no effect. Despite claiming that his vision was augmented the default light augmentation only makes the player glow like a Christmas tree instead of granting nightvision, which is soon made rather pointless anyways.\\nComically, the game is hilariously easy for a simple reason, the weapons used by both the player and the enemy switch between useless and over-powered. About a quarter into the game the player is granted the Dragon Tooth, basically a lightsaber that kills absolutely everything that is human in one hit(even \\'boss\\' enemies die to two or three hits with this thing, usually to only one if it hits the head); say goodbye to useless pistols and rifles that JC can\\'t aim to save his life; yes, just sit there until your cataracts stop acting up JC, eventually you\\nto hit him! Really, there is absolutely no reason to use anything else except for it and the GEP gun. Speaking of the GEP gun, at the very start of the game the player is granted the options of getting a crossbow, a sniper rifle, or a GEP gun. Only mere meters away from the person who gives it to you is a free crossbow anyways. The GEP gun can kill anything is that is -or is not- human in one shot, it even comes with a lock-on feature to any target in the game! So there\\'s the Dream Team: The Dragon Tooth and the GEP gun! Both available right at the start of the game! Incidentally the enemy also has access to such weapons, whom are virtually harmless as it takes them\\nto register that the player is a threat, that is if they actually see the player as their field of vision is about 5 meters far. Believe me I wanted to use the Plasma Rifle instead, but that thing is a peice of trash that deals no damage, takes too long to load, has an effective range about as big as its splash radious, the ammo is practically non-existent, and anything worth shooting at with it has an energy shield. All the other guns in this game suck for one reason or another actually, usually for their terrible damage and accuracy.\\nThe game features a little economy which is close to pointless as there are very few shops that sell things the player actually needs, so if the player has been hacking ATMs since the start it would be best to buy absolutely everything they find that isn\\'t food as they will have few chances to buy anything else unless they\\'re fans of hoarding Soylent Green chocolate bars.\\nThe story starts out rather predicably, the player plays as JC Dention, who they can actually give a \\'real\\' name to which in true RPG fashion is mentioned only in text files on very few of the game\\'s PCs. They work for the big bad gov\\'ment and have to stop the terrorists from stealing the useless vaccine for the plague, and I\\'m sure you already see where this is going. Mere hours(apparently a day, but I can\\'t tell since there\\'s no sun in this game) after joining the force JC betrays the gov\\'ment and fights for the terrorists and it turns out that the plague is man-made and the terrorists can make a cure! So with the help of some Artificial Intelligences and a bunch of useless jerks JC singlehandedly kills all the bad guys, launches some nukes, and destroys some bases before he reaches the final base that needs to explode and the game suddenly decides that it wouldn\\'t be an RPG if there weren\\'t final choices! Which feels rather token considering that game had no meaningful choices before that point, and it certainly didn\\'t start there, since the only thing this choice does is grant a minute long cutscene and a quote from some moron from the 17th century before cuting to the credits.',\n",

The campaign is rather short and the story is cheesy. I really wish they made the story more grounded and realistic without any supernatural elements.\\nThe multiplayer mode is boring except for the survival mode. The survival mode really shines, it makes ranking up a fun and addictive things to do because you can't just hack n slash your way through. You actually need good strategy, good co-op partner, and better gears to survive longer. Sadly there is no survival time leaderboard to show how well you do it.\\nYou unlock higher tier of gears every time you reach certain rank, once that tier unlocked, you hunt for better gears by buying a pack. Each pack only give you few random gears and you can complete your collection by... wait for it... keep playing to earn more golds and ranking up to unlock new tiers.\\nCONCLUSION :\\nRecommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.\",\n",

I mainly came to this game because one of my friends had just picked up Half-Life from a sale, and I wanted to guide him through it. We both downloaded Sven Co-op, and played along the chapters of the original Half-Life. The only issues I experienced were lag, but that is not unusual in multiplayer games. Sven also introduces many other games with different tasks.\\nSven Co-op is a must-buy for those wanting a nostalgic flashback or wanting to experience the Half-Life game with friends.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Sniper Elite V2 did everything it could to make me hate it.   It starts by showing you stealth, and how awesome it\\'s bullet cam is, and teaches you how to play the game.\\nThen it follows it up with a second mission that is impossible to stealth.  The only thing the game shows you up to that point is stealth so you think \"This game is broken.\"  and honestly, yeah it is.  The stealth in this game is broken, it\\'s not \"non existant\" it\\'s just not possible to do in the second mission (and other missions).   So I put down the game because screw it.  It\\'s not fun.\\nAbout a year later I returned to Sniper Elite V2, and said \"Screw it, let\\'s just beat the game, get some achievements and never play it again.\"   I threw the game on \"Cadet\" and I decide to give it one last shot.\\nI\\'m glad I did.  Sniper Elite V2 is a horrible stealth game.  But it\\'s a fun \"sniping\" game.  You don\\'t play this game like you would play the epic Call of Duty Modern Warfare Sniping level.   You instead play it like you play the rest of the call of duty levels.  Yes you can stealth many parts of the game, but it takes forever and often one misstep brings everything down on you and you\\'ll restart.   Instead the minute you misstep, say \"Screw it\" and go out gun blazing.  In fact this game has a REALLY good sniper set up.  The player has quite a few tools at his disposal, the Sniping is challenging but fun, the ai does remember where they saw the player last (Which means you can move and then snipe who ever comes looking) and there is a really good level design work here.\\nAnd the kill cam.  Dear god, the kill cams are amazing.  For a five year old game, watching a bullet penetrate an enemy from 100 miles away in a unique way every time is weirdly glorious.  The bullet travels, the air manipulated around it until it penetrates (And yes penetrates is the right word) into a body, moving through vital organs until it exits.  It\\'s a glorious moment and while it\\'s over done a bit, it\\'s exciting at least 75 percent of the time, and probably closer to 100.  It\\'s just an absolute exciting experience especially when you pull off that 400 meter shot, or you successfully nail the perfect shot.\\nSo does it make it a good game.  Well that depends.  It\\'s not a great military shooter, but it is a VERY fun sniping game.  I really prefer it on the easier difficulty, and the game feels broken once in a while, or unfair.  But the game makes up for it in visuals, and that feeling when each mission\\'s plan comes together.  It COULD be better, and it\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s worth a play.  I don\\'t know if I\\'d pay the full 20 bucks for it, but for 10 bucks or less it\\'s easily worth the money and time to play through it.',\n",

You guide Howard as he goes through these dreams and solves puzzles and begins to unravel the mystery of his own mind. What makes Dream so unique is that the narrative and path you take is up to you. There are many paths to choose from and each them weirder then the last. There are many details in the game that make it's story and universe rich. Along the same lines of Gone Home, you can pick up items and learn more about Howard and the houses former tenant. However, this is far from just some simple walking simulator. (even though I don't think that's a bad name/genre) There are several puzzles that keep you involved in the games story and makes you feel like an active participant, even if you don't know necessarily what is going on. Dream is gorgeous in design, music, and sound, it's game that must be experienced to truly understand. The tone of game can shift in seconds, as every dream, can be become a nightmare. This tonal shift keeps you on edge and makes the game feel suspenseful. I feel like I barely scratched the surface of Dream and there is  so much more to see and do in this journey.\\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\\nI hope you enjoy!\\nMartyr\",\n",

I\\'d been hesitant to buy it for this reason, however having now picked it up during a sale (a whopping $1.75) I was able to try it out. Having ran through the surprisingly short campaign (it took me four hours to complete, all within a single sitting, on the highest difficulty setting), I know understand why the game was so ill recieved by some. K&L:DM is a bog standard cover based third-person shooter in its gameplay, and that gameplay is subpar at best. Most weapons I found to be completely inaccurate at anything beyond short range, enemies were basically bullet sponges (however this may be attributed to the difficulty I was playing on), the movement was clunky, and attempting to get behind cover often resulted in either awkwardly walking against a wall, or sticking to cover that you didn\\'t mean to stick to. Your AI teammates also seemed to be pretty dim as well. This, at points, lead to very frustrating moments, and many undeserved deaths. It\\'s still functional, but it isn\\'t sharp by any means. Where the game does shine however is in its narrative and atmosphere. The entire game felt grimey, from the characters to the enviroment and even the soundtrack. It nailed the \"criminal\" feeling quite well. The story was also quite good, although nothing I haven\\'t seen before. Interesting (if a bit shallow) characters, and funny dialogue with more cuss words than a bar full of sailors propelled it forward. If you\\'re willing to slog through the sketchy mechanics, then there\\'s a good afternoons time to be had with this game. Though do as I did, and pick it up on sale. For cheap, I\\'d definitely recommend it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hitman Contracts is the third installment of the Hitman franchise. The game opens up with 47 entering a motel set in France. After an assignment gone wrong, he\\'s been wounded and is moments away from being hunted down by a squadron of a French S.W.A.T. team lead by a police official whom 47 was trying to assassinate. As 47 tries to recover from his wounds, he starts to remember his missions from his past including missions when he was first enlisted into the ICA. Once more the graphics are improved a notch and the controls are also given an upgrade making this game more playable than the first two games as there aren\\'t as many flaws as present as I was used to seeing in the previous installments. The FMV sequences are very well animated, you know the development now has the software to create a great game. As in the second game, the weapons obtain in each level are usable once you have beaten the game. Only guns are collectable in the game and not melee weapons like in the last game. There are more weapons to choose from as well as certain weapons only obtainable when achieving a \"Silent Assassin\" reward. Making this game highly replayable, you can\\'t go wrong with this almost perfect sequal to everyone\\'s favorite bald anti-hero.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Uplink is a game that simulates being a hacker. It is novel and superficially well-done, but after I played for an hour or so, the novelty wore off and I was left with a lot of flawed and confusing game mechanics.\\nPros:\\n+ Very immersive. The game does a nice job of making you feel like the main character. In fact, it almost feels like you are a real hacker at times.\\n+ Good sense of gradually building yourself up from scratch. There is a certain satisfaction in upgrading your programs and computers step by step.\\nCons:\\n- A lot of aspects of the game are very poorly explained. Once you get through the basics, you have to look everything up on the internet because what the different hacking programs do and how/when to use them is very unclear. Several times I literally didn't know what I was supposed to be attempting in a mission.\\n- Poor mission variety makes the game very repetitive. Add to this the fact that a given mission can be completed exactly the same way every time you get it. Mission are fun the first one or two times you get each one, but then just become a chore.\\n- The game mechanics are very susceptible to tricks, loopholes, and exploits. This is the type of game that seems very hard until you figure out a couple of little tricks that make it painfully easy. Then it just becomes a repetitive grind of using the same tricks over and over. I'm honestly not sure if several of the techniques I used were the intended mechanics of the game or were game-breaking oversights.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This passage taken from a discarded poem found in one of the cabins is actually a successful definition for the game itself. A sense of isolation, desperation and abandonment are the building blocks of\\n, a minimalistic psychological horror by David Szymanski. I\\'ve been meaning to play this for a long while, and finally managed to spare an undivided hour to complete it, which is a prerequisite of completion since there is no save game feature. The game is intended to be played in one sitting of an hour, and all there is to explore would fill that hour completely anyhow. The definition of my experience was an effectively uncanny environment mixed with a bit bleak story revelation.\\nThe game starts in complete darkness, in a warehouse that resides on a shore line, and there is no one else besides us. We learn that\\n. We start walking, exploring the island and try to put things together through reminiscences of our character. By gameplay function, this is a walking simulation since there is nothing else to do rather than explore. So no monsters to jump at you if you are in expectancy of a \"big bad wolf coming at you\" scenario.\\nThe island itself isn\\'t that big; but the howling wind, the approaching darkness and constant clouds of dust establish an appropriately plain yet ominous setting. I wouldn\\'t call graphics anything extraordinary - minimalistic even - but the choice and display in decoration combinations are in artistic value to set the mood. Added with a sorrowful soundtrack, there is no doubt that we exist in an ultimately forlorn geography without a clue to any happenstance and feel that isolation, that helplessness every second of our one hour gameplay.\\nOn story purposes: aside being quite successful in atmosphere,\\neither fails to explain much, or intentionally leaves matters unspoken. In either case, anecdotal memories or vague dialogues exchanged by intended characters don\\'t reveal much aside a single act of desperation that would either doom or salvage the former inhabitants. There is no explanation for the purpose of the island, or how people ended up being there in the first place. As it is, this game feels like a glorious demo which would promise for things to come. I heard that there could be some explanation for the background in David Szymanski\\'s next game,\\nwhich I didn\\'t play yet. If so, I strongly recommend playing two games back to back to track a complete story.\\nDo I recommend it? Yes, for observing a complete success on establishing an atmosphere with too little in graphics, but on narrative achievement, I must say that I\\'ve seen better. For your half a dollar, it is a good experience. I\\'ll be keeping an eye for more David Szymanski games in the future.\\nNow that I\\'ve completed\\n, I\\'m positive that these two games should be played back to back. In unison, they form a beautiful story, the tale of a creation and its undoing. Buy them together, enjoy an age old story in some really radical context!\\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller\\'s Curator page\\n- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!',\n",

       "  'text': 'I got this for cheap, and I have to say, even with my expectations kind of low, I\\'m still a bit disappointed. However, I\\'ve noticed that many of the negative reviews here can be summed up to, \"Adware is bad!!1! ecks dee.\" While adware is despicable anywhere, including here, (though calling an easily deleted script that opens a web browser page \"adware\" is extremely generous as far as I\\'m concerned), I\\'m going to try and judge this on its own merits, just the game itself.\\nTo describe it without context: Enclave is an action game with RPG elements. The player controls one of several classes, fighting through often linear levels to accomplish a specific goal. Along the way, the player will collect gold and jewels. The more of such items the player collects during the level, the better equipment he or she can apply to said classes, increasing the player\\'s effectiveness in combat.\\nFrom that description, I can\\'t label exactly what is wrong. It\\'s not one big thing; It\\'s a bunch of little things.\\nGraphicaly, the game is hitting that point where you can see how old it is, but  everything looks detailed enough. Aside from the occasional 2D models and flickering skyboxes, it\\'s fine.\\nThe music all sounds the same.\\nThe story is forgettable. I mean, I really tried to care about it, but it\\'s just one of those things that tries way too hard to have lore, and fails because I have no real way of connecting the piles of orcs and goblins I\\'m slaying with what is happening in the story. The levels just feel like levels, not actual places with depth. It\\'s backed up by some fair voice acting. I particularly like the goblins\\' dialogue.\\nThe levels are mostly linear. On a very rare occasion, you\\'ll be given some open areas to explore, but for the most part, the goal is to just reach the end. On a side note, it also seems to have a very subtle physics engine, though it\\'s more likely to get you killed than the platforming controls... which also often result in death.\\nI\\'ve also noticed that the game has an unhealthy addiction to scripted events. Not the \"quick-time event, rail-shooter\" kind, but the \"invisible trigger, something you can\\'t prepare for\" kind. Let me give an example. The harbor level. I go up some stairs, a goblin jumps out, I kill it. Later, I\\'m running across the bridges while some orcs beyond the fog shoot cannonballs at me. One of them hits the bridge, the bridge breaks, as I fall into the water, I can see how the bridge fell apart. By this time in the game, I\\'ve been playing long enough to know that this sort of event always happens the same way. So, I figure, next time, I\\'ll just inchworm my way toward that part, and then jump over after the gap (which I fell through) has appeared. Because, you know, my first instinct when someone fires a cannon at me is to wait patiently.\\nNow, I\\'m starting over from the beginning of the level, because I want all of the gold, and you can\\'t get all of the gold if you restart at a checkpoint. I get to the part with the goblin who jumps out at me when I go up the stairs, but I stay at the bottom of the stairs. I\\'m playing as the Druid, who has an attack capable of shooting through walls. I know exactly where the goblin is going to jump out from. So, I take a few shots at where the goblin would be before jumping out, and what happens? Nothing. Nada. Diddly squat. The goblin doesn\\'t even spawn until I go up the stairs.\\nMy point is, if the bridge event is going to require trial and error, why can I not take a cautious approach with the goblin as well? It feels like the game is just jerking me around.\\nAnyway, getting as much gold as you can is pretty important. The difficulty ramps up fairly quickly, and you\\'re going to want to be able to afford the best stuff. Yet this can also fall victim to the scripted sequences, sometimes dropping gold out of reach, or sealing it off after crossing some invisible trigger, which requires playing a level again to get it all. The fact that they made anything this hard to obtain in as linear a game as this is, is in my opinion, an amazing feat.\\nThe combat, oh boy. Clearly, this was the focus of the game, as diplomacy won\\'t get you far here. Melee combat feels floaty. It\\'s hard to control where you swing weapons, especially if the weapon is a tiny little dagger. You can use a shield if you want, but I find it to be useless most of the time. The slower enemies can be outmaneuvered, while the input lag is so bad that faster enemies can easily hit you whether you\\'re trying to block or not. Consider the fact that the game also likes to have multiple enemies surround the player, and I often find myself just running into crowds, mashing the left mouse button.\\nTheoretically, this would mean that the best option against enemies who don\\'t have a ranged attack is to just walk backwards and shoot them with your ranged weapon until they bite the dust, and sometimes it works, when there\\'s nothing on the ground that blocks their path. When something does block them, good lord. I want to know who designed this AI, because this is just so weird. When an enemy is not walking directly at you in a straight line, anything can happen, it\\'s unpredictable, it\\'s like fighting a Smith guy from the Matrix. They can vault 5 foot boxes, they can weave left and right more than Florida between election years, they can stub their toes on thin air and as a result just stand in place. Couple this with the fact that the game doesn\\'t really have effective hitscan weapons, and it\\'s Tribes: Ascend Syndrome x1000.\\nThe ultimate effect that all this has on the game is that there\\'s little way to prepare for battles without a lot of trial and error, especially with the enemy funnels and often one-sided approaches to level completion.\\nIf I have to say a few good things, I can. The classes, for the most part, feel different and unique, like a good class system should. The extra \"Dark\" campaign provides some extra gameplay value, and I have to say that I enjoyed it more than the \"Light\" campaign, for its more open mission and level structures, which allow for more creativity. It also has some pretty sweet modding tools if you can get your hands on them. I suggest following this:\\nIn the end, I have to say, as a whole, it just feels mediocre as a game. It\\'s frustrating, it\\'s boring because so much of my gametime has simply been trial and error. It just feels unfinished and unpolished. I\\'m sure there\\'s something else out there that does what this wanted to do, but better.',\n",

It will provide some decent entertainment in the here and now but it will never be remembered for anything.\\nEarth 2160 sets you in the future, corporations fight for control over the Solar System\\'s dwindling resources as a new discovery rocks the power structure and sets the game\\'s events in motion. As you start out you get to play as either a generic male dominated corporation or the curiously female dominated Mars corporation. They both, not surprisingly, turn out to be evil rather quickly into the campaign and you eventually get to play as the \"good\" faction, a generic robot corporation that really has no personality and eventually, a menacing alien horde.\\nThe storyline really isn\\'t anything to write home about, it\\'s all pretty standard stuff, good guys works for the bad corporation but eventually rebels against them. The dialog and cut scenes are of a particularly low quality that will often make you cringe at just how awful it really is.\\nWhere Earth 2160 gains a points is in the gameplay however, each faction has a unique set of units and a unique way of base construction, the Mars women for example focusing on individual strong point structures that can have additional modules added on top for research, defense or unit production whereas the alien horde have no real base construction instead focusing entirely on cloning and evolving their units.\\nAnd as if this uniqueness to each faction wasn\\'t enough each faction come with a complete research tree and the ability to customize each unit with various types of weapons, shields and engines allowing you to really make the faction your own. This customization does have it\\'s flaws however, particularly where single-player is concerned as the AI does not adapt to your unit builds it is fairly trivial to make an exact counter to what the AI is building and just stomp them using rock-paper-scissors.\\nThe slight RPG elements wherein you occasionally have a hero unit or two that can pick up items feels somewhat misplaced and rarely add anything beyond something to worry about as losing a hero often leads to a game over.\\nEarth 2160 is not a bad game and it\\'s a game you can get a lot of fun out of especially if you skip past the cut scenes. it is however not a game that will stand the test of time and as such it\\'s not really something I\\'d recommend anyone buys any longer.',\n",

But the reason i'm giving this a bad review is because once your city becomes larger (70k+ people), your population growth starts to oscillate. What I mean is, the population would grow to 70k, then a lot of people randomly die, although the health system is good. It would drop to 60k.  Then, it'd grow back to 80 or 90k, just to drop back again to 70k. This happens in a pretty short time, half an hour maybe? This goes on and on... and it really ruins the game for me.

       "  'text': \"One of the most enjoyable, unique, and memorable gaming experiences I've ever had. I played Stage 2 from the start and I'll keep doing it until there's no one to play. No computer game has ever made my heart pound and my breath short like this one. The frantic rage of the monster you control is communicated almost effortlessly by the mechanics, and playing as a hunter is an exercise in cunning and teamwork that is truly rewarding. Of the hundreds of hours I've spent on hundreds of games, my short time with Evolve will always stand out in my memory with games like Diablo II, Halo CE, and Portal as stunning examples of the multifaceted art that video games can be and the emotions and experiences they can communicate and generate.\\n---\\nThe game is strongly biased against monster with skilled players. If one hunter is off of his game the monster can be competitive, but hunting is a walk in the park for any group without an incompetent player. It's very depressing to get matched with a premade hunter team with mics because the fight will always be robotically difficult for the monster. I feel cheesy playing as hunter - the only time I lose is if a team member throws the game. Hitting your abilities as hunter is much easier than as monster and the job of killing is divided between 4 brains as opposed to one. In Stage 1 the hunt itself balanced that difficulty, but in Stage 2 the hunt is almost gone.\\nThe devs really seemed to care about the game until the end of development. I disagreed with a lot of the stuff they did, but none of it was slimy or scheming.\\nIt worries me that they are trying the tried-and-false tactic of changing game mechanics to appeal to new players. Now the new players are waning because, duh, there are only so many. The game seems to be dying again, and many of the changes they make revolve around making the game more predicable and regular, driving away old players.\\nDefinitely worth a shot, I have a ton of fun in this game.\",\n",

I like how the BFG has it's own ammo from the Plasma Gun unlike DooM and DooM II: Hell on Earth. I like the new enemies and the return of old enemies, and overall the vibe this game gives off is really amazing. The storyline is rather unique but still takes the task of being on Mars but with a bit of a twist from the first two DooM games. Overall, my final verdict on this game would be an 8.7/10.

       "  'text': \"Back to Bed is an isometric puzzle game where you play a sleeper's subconscious (which is obviously a green dog with a human face) struggling to keep him from waking up. The sleeper, Bob, sleepwalks around levels and turns right whenever he encounters an object. To get him back to bed, you have to rearrange apples and fish, keep him away from alarm clocks and dogs, and remember that dream levels work like M.C. Esher paintings. Seriously, level 2-14, don't forget.\\nThis game looks really good, honestly. They nailed the aesthetic they were going for, with weird dreamscapes out of a Dali painting and cartoony characters. There's a cool voice-over that talks like a backwards recording and some really neat setpieces like the whale locomotive. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty pretty evenly (as long as you remember the Esher thing!) and do a good job of introducing new mechanics. It's solid and pretty and clever, which makes me sad that it's so short. For some reason, the main game is split into two chapters of 15 puzzles each, 30 total. The first few are tutorial-style levels to teach new mechanics, and the gradual ramp-up in challenge means only the last 3-4 puzzles of either chapter are actually hard. There are Nightmare versions of both chapters you unlock by beating the normal ones, but those are just the same levels with extra keys you have to direct Bob to pick up. So technically there are 60 puzzles, but half are hard mode repeats. I beat all 30 normal levels and the first 7 Nightmare levels in a little over an hour, so yeah, it's pretty short. Still, if the presentation is at all appealing to you, it's worth picking up.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This is what Tormentum starts with, a well known quotation from one of the most popular philosophers Germany has to offer. What defines human ethics? Is reason the source of morality? You should know by now that Tormentum neither answers this questions solely nor tries to do so, but stimulating the player’s mind with radical issues presented in gruesome but hand-painted actions and pictures instead of reading Kant’s essay might work better, at least for gamers. Your actions and decisions will affect your story, always leaving you behind with one question left. Did I make the\\nchoice?\\nIntroduction done. Don’t worry, this is not about philosophy, it is about\\n, a game that looks like our worst nightmares got caught and painted by H.R.Giger. Some of those bad dreams might even haunt you after the game is over but even then you just can’t stop looking at every small detail, whether it looks amusing, terrifying or violent. Speaking of terror and violence, we should take a look at Tormentum’s story. You are...well. Who are you? You are somebody,  yet no one. A poor creature wearing a capuchin, that gets imprisoned in an old, horrendous looking castle, threatened with torture and punishment for sins you cannot remember. Survival is your only thought and thus keeps your motivation alive even after having seen the suffering your new home has to offer. Prepare for morale choices that will not only affect yourself and keep that one thing in mind: Nobody is what they claims to be.\\nWhile Tormentum does look like a classic point-and-click at first sight, it uses some hidden object influences, mixes it up and combines them with classical puzzles and riddles. These are not unbeatable since you will find many clues but expect to be fairly challenged. May it be the right time on a watch, a certain melody that needs to be played or a man-eating worm that blocks your path, you will love the variety. There is no button for highlighting things, some objects have a unique glow instead whilst others can be hard to find sometimes. Additionally, objects can neither be combined in your inventory nor used for multiple actions. This may sounds simple but it fits the idea Tormentum wants to convey. The only time this really bothered me was early on after the start where you get confronted with many different scenes and tasks. If one link is missing in the chain you get stuck forever, running through the same backgrounds multiple times. These are eyecatchers even after passing them again and again, so do not lose  your confidence, there is a clue or hint for everything.\\nBefore listing major points, I want to take a second look at the atmosphere Tormentum creates. I can’t talk enough about the graphics, or better, art OhNoo Studio created here. There won’t be many scenes you may find peaceful or cheering though, but would you really expect that to happen when a game is called Tormentum? You will witness pain, torture and suffering, everywhere. One can only imagine how a world would look like where evil lurks everywhere and redemption seems to be the only escape, but if this world really exists I fear it would look like Tormentum. Creepy People and Creatures, a dying land, epic but disgusting monuments, fire that rains from the sky, everything brought to life or death with hand-drawn masterpieces. Whoever created the soundtrack and effects should be awarded, too. My first impression was a bit monotonous but it quickly became the perfect skin for its cadaverous body. Emotions can be heard without even knowing what happens in the current scene.\\nSeeing this game getting Greenlit made me proud and happy since I backed it on Kickstarter myself, but when it got released the two of us couldn’t match. I am not a fan of Hidden Object games and playing the first couple of minutes I felt that this was not the game I expected. My opinion changed as you might have already guessed.\\nOnce the story gets its hands on you, luring you with choices, challenging with puzzles, playing with morality and disturbing with violence, Tormentum starts to become more than just a piece of unforgettable sound, visuals and artwork. Staring at the screen for more than 5 minutes, pondering your next decision, you will ask yourself again: What is the right choice? Whether you know Kant or not, this will affect you.\\nVerdict: 8,5 / 10',\n",

The sci-fi setting definitely brings some of that sweet deep space atmosphere into the game. At later stages the game can become a bit overwhelming and you will need to play a stage several times in order to know and predict the risks that come with deep space travel. The dialogue is nice and some of the puns even made me smile every now and then. No phenomenal writing can be expected here though.\\nIf you're a strategy fan and like the idea of micromanaging your space ship, which happen in exotic but dangerous deep space environments similar to ones found in Star Wars, Star Trek or even Dead Space, you may very well like this game.\\nI heartwarmingly recommend!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A pretty fun experience. Changing up the linear story line from previous games, Black Ops 2 allows you to essentially choose your own ending based on many different decisions you make during the campaign. I actually did enjoy this feature, and I think it definitely helped the game in the long run. The majority of complaints I have with the game are based on the problems that can occur when playing the game with a refresh rate higher than 60 Hz, such as extremely slow acceleration and movement at certain times and animation glitches, though if you run the game at a typical 60 Hz, you should have very few issues.\\nOne problem I had that could have been related to either refresh rate or mouse DPI was the game's failure to recognize my mouse movement in certain sections of the game. Aiming was fine and mostly everything else was as well, but the issue was prevalent when piloting an aircraft, controlling a CLAW, or riding a horse. I was simply unable to turn the camera, and it caused these several parts to be much more difficult. In the one where I was piloting an aircraft, I was forced to play the short section with a controller in order to complete it, and it turned out to be very easy once I did so. Visual clipping through a rare few models may occur if the field of view is set to the maximum as well.\\nOverall, if your refresh rate is 60 Hz and you play with a low DPI mouse, you should have very few problems with your experience. This game is clearly designed to be played with a controller, but it you're like me and would always prefer playing an FPS with a mouse rather than a joystick if you had the option, then a mouse is doable. Aside from any technical problems the game might have, it offers an engaging story if you listen to it and try to understand (otherwise, it is very easy to lose track of what direction the game is taking). The few strike-force missions the game offers aren't very enjoyable, mostly due to the complexity of their mechanics making unit regulation more of a chore than anything, but the other missions are fun. The characters the game introduces are interesting and are definitely one of the game's strong suits.\\nAt the moment, it's 3:13 in the morning, and I'm completely burned out, and this review was probably absolute rubbish, so I'll sum it up my thoughts with this: if you like CoD, you'll have a fun time with this game.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is the mouthful of a title given to developer Asteroid Base's inaugural game. I actually got to preview this at PAX Prime earlier this year and it was one of the most popular titles in the indie area and with good reason. Lovers is a cooperative space exploration game where two players must cooperate to man various stations on a spaceship to navigate through space and rescue little space critters. In order to complete a level, a certain number of little space critters has to be rescued for the exit to be unlocked but if you and your partner are feeling like completionists, you can collect all of the critters in each stage to get access to different model ships and unlock other powerups faster. The locations of the critters and the entire world as a whole are totally differently systematically generated on each run, giving every playthrough a fresh feel. Once you find a critter, usually some small challenge has to be completed before you can rescue them. For example, you may have to fight several waves of enemies, escape an explosion or fight a mini boss.\\nThere are various stations to man on each ship including weapons, shields, engines and a powerful yamato cannon weapon. There are several campaigns that are made up of 4 levels and a final boss fight. Each level offers upgrade crystals that you can install in your systems that will persist throughout the campaign. Deciding which crystals to place in which systems is initially a fun experimental learning process, but I've found once you know what the crystal combinations do, you usually fall into a pattern of upgrading that results in a familiar ship layout each time. But there are also several ship layouts to unlock in the game, each with their own stats and quirky gameplay rules. For instance, there's one unlockable ship that constantly rotates around while you play, making locating and controlling your character within the ship quite a challenge, but as a tradeoff, the ship is also immune to terrain damage. I'm a sucker for these kinds of unlockable gameplay variations and this game reminded me a bit of my favorite FTL from the space exploration and battles right down to the unlockable ships. Obviously the gameplay is nowhere close to the same, but there are similarities to be drawn between the two roguelike space exploration games\\nThere are only two crew members, making coordination and teamwork a key to success in this game. Communication with your partner is necessary and coming up with a good strategy is vital so that you and your teammate aren't running to the same stations to man the same systems. Once you get that strategy established and you and your partner know how to run the ship like seasoned space travelers, it's a really neat feeling. But it's also just as fun to yell and scream at your partner when things are going horribly wrong and your ship is about to explode\\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime offers the best experiences for couch co-op play. It's conceptually simple to learn and easy to pick up and play. But there's still a decent amount of strategy, skill and depth to be found here as well, and applying these strategies skill and depth of understanding of the game is especially necessary in the later levels where the difficulty gets ratcheted up quite a bit. I really enjoyed this game; it's one of the best couch cooperative experiences I've had. If you and a friend are looking for something to play, you can't go wrong with Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Another year and another year of beta testing FM. My first impression after 90 hours is that there are fewer bugs this season than previously, so that bodes well. By this time last year, I had at least a dozen fatal crashes, this season I have had 4 so far. Not a lot seems different yet but the new features are what everyone wants to know more about, so I digress. The game is slower overall.\\nLet me start by saying that since I joined the SI Forums back in 2003 I have always been a fan of the wish lists. In 2009 I started making a list compiled from the most commonly requested features, at the time I was curious how many would be implemented. I have kept this list going and still have it with each subsequent year Wishlist thread added to it. I can safely say that from 2009 until this 2018 version SI have added exactly 5 things from the 25 most requested features people want to see. This is not a good ratio. How many people asked for a manager on the sideline last year? It wasn’t even in the top 100.\\nThis season has two “major” additions, first the Dynamics, which adds an even further element of making this managerial game into a babysitting simulator. It is not enough you have to argue with limited AI players constantly just to keep your job but now they gang up on top of it! Where did dynamics rate on the top 100 most requested features? Again, not even in the top 100.\\nThe next big addition is the way scouting it done. Now instead of scouting and getting lists of players in your inbox you get one screen with a list of players you must go through one by one. Instead of having to scroll to the top to have read them all, you can just click one button to have them all go away. Or, you could go through them one by one, but once those lists get large it gets tedious to do. It is slightly more streamlined, or at the very least, appears that way.\\nThere are numerous other smaller additions that really do not register as having a large affect on the game itself and things most complained about such as the repetition of interviews has not changed at all. It is still the best football management game available but that says very little since the competition is thin at best. Will I play it? Yes, probably for thousands of hours again, because there is no real alternative to FM and that alone makes it the best but would I recommend it? No, this is another season with few changes and even fewer that anyone asked for. It makes me wonder why the Wishlist thread existed at all, since it is rarely used. My list compiles the 100 or so most recommended features for FM, and I am not going to post it here but most people know some of the bigger ones, whether they support them or not. In no particular order here are a few (disclaimer, these are not MY suggestions, I do not even support them all, these are compiled from the official SI forum Wishlist thread since 2009, which is now its own forum since the thread was closed);\\n1.\\tSomething you can actually use your managers money on. Right now, it is supposed to be used to determine part of your job stability but we all know once you are at a huge club it makes no difference. Also, has anyone ever noticed that you can’t ever become the highest paid manager? I have overtaken Sir Alex atop the Hall of Fame every season and have never been the top paid manager in the game. Pus you can’t actually negotiate a contract, it will let you take less money for more years but very little is actually negotiable with your contract, it is more or less take it or leave it. The most common suggestion is to use your money to invest in a team or buy a team later in your career.\\n2.\\tMore modes than just a manager mode. Now this one does seem a little silly since it is called Football MANAGER and that is usually the line given to those who suggest this, but in this same vein a major requested feature is the ability to manage teams other than the big club, like work your way up from U18 or U23, I count this as the same suggestion when tallying for my list.\\n3.\\tThis one has been worded in many different ways but the gist is a training mode, something you can use to see your tactics out of a game and tinker with it so you can actually see what your instructions do.\\n4.\\tA very subjective one and this one is taken from a lot of different suggestions and kind of mashed into one but people really seem to want to see less “unrealistic” results, which are actually quite realistic but they seem to want to win every game in which they “play better”, match this with the vast and overwhelming number of people who want to see less injuries and what do we get? Really this boils down to one large suggestion, setting sliders. Yep, customization is a huge thing people ask for year after year and these are just two things they wish to adjust to their desires. Most sports simulation games aim to have a good level of customization, FM is one of the few that really gives you little option in what happens in your game universe, realistic or not.\\n5.\\tIt is amazing how many people post every year about how they want more options in their interviews, we have had literally the same set of questions and answers for an eternity it seems. People want to be able to say what they want to say, not choose from 5 bland answers that they would probably never say in real life. How is that realism?\\n6.\\tFix the transfer system. This one is also suggested en masse with different ways to suggest it. The most common being something akin to; “why did I not get player X for ten million and the team Y got him for eight million?” or even, “How is player X ‘worth’ 10 million but he actually costs 80 million? Isn’t he worth 80 million then?”. Now I don’t pretend to have all the answers, much, but this one gets posted a lot and I have no real idea how they would do it better.\\n7.\\tA wider and vaster academy system, not just some random youth players who come in every season. Simple request.\\n8.\\tCustomization. I know I said it before, that one was related to the two most posted, game results with skewed statistics and injuries but this request is vast and includes things such as; turning off star ratings, sliders on small things like PPM difficulty (who likes having their staff constantly tell them they don’t think player X can do the thing you want him to learn?), optional social media and interviews, optional Brexit and more. This list could go on forever but I think many people say things like “just look at OOTP”.\\nNow if you got this far, you are probably wondering how this is a review for FM 18 and it has to be said, most reviews are about what is in the game, I am using my data to show you what is still not in the game after all this time. These suggestions are the top few on the Wishlist thread since 2009! This tells you how much your voices mean and what kind of game to expect. I am by no means saying to stay away and don’t buy it, because we all need our FM fix and this game is still the best in the market but I am saying I do not recommend it this season for the fact it just doesn’t add enough to make it worth buying in my opinion.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I first played Stonehearth back in alpha, and thought that it wasn't as much of a deal back then, but was largely intrigued by the well-rounded corners the developers mainly got around to. It was appealing and affectionate; something the current game libraries didn't offer a lot of. Granted, I took the jump into the warm water and it was mainly filled with bugs. Like a LOT of bugs.\\nThankfully, many patches and versions later, we get to play this much more toned, much more carved game that really resonated with me in a lot of ways. This game has the appealing factor of Minecraft, the RTS-feel of Tropico meets Banished and forms a bond that revolves around both styles really well. You could say it's like an RTS/RPG but that is also missing the mark.\\nGranted, it is still in alpha, but damn do I love this game. After getting back in a month later, many problems were fixed, while there were problems lingering. Still, this game is fantastically crafted and makes you feel as if while creating your little village, that you're connected with your Hearthlings, a.k.a your units/villagers. What's interesting is that there is an objective, and not mindless building nor reacting to an enemy assault from orcs. This game makes you feel as if you're working together with your Hearthlings, and it is damn awesome.\\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, there are a TON to do and TONS MORE coming! This game has potential, and also if there are known bugs DO let the developers know. Let's make this gem of a game shine. Congrats to Team Radiant! This is one hell of a fantastic game!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Imagine counter strike with swords. That's how I felt it when I played the game first time. It's smooth to play and requires skill. It's fast paced and a game you can jump in and out. Have only 30min to play ? No problem you can jump in a lobby and have fun. This is one of those games which sucks you in and time flies by when you play it.\\nBase game contains 4 classes which have all unique weapons and playstyle to keep the game interesting. Keep playing with certain class and a weapon type and kill enemies (other players) to rank up expirience points to unlock new different weapons with different stats. Such as weapon swing speed, reach and base damage. As I mentioned game requires skill and there is no ''overpowered'' weapons. You can dominate anyone with any weapon if you just know how to use it. So you do not have to worry that players that have played the game a long time would have weapon wise a advantage. What they do have, is expirience with the game.\\nGame has few game modes to choose from. Some are very familiar such as free for all, team deatmatch and capture the flag. Though I personally like team objective missions. These missions have unique objectives which keeps the game interesting and you feel like there is a real battle going on with a purpose behind it. For example you have to light a signal fire to let your fleet to know to move in and open fire on the walls while the other team tries to stop you from doing that. If your able to signal the battle ships they destroy the wall and a new objective is given, destroy the enemy catapults so they won't demolish your fleet that just moved in etc. It's interesting over any regular game modes.\\nThere's plenty of maps to play and as I said team objectives are totally different in each map and they are very fun to play.\\nGameplay itself is smooth and responsive, and as I mentioned fast paced so you better not be day dreaming. Keep your guard up and play smart. Remember that your weapon can damage and kill your friends so do not just mindlessly swing your weapon.\\nGame looks visually nice and has plenty of blood and gore in it. The sounds, death screams, swords colliding with other swords, flesh getting cut, arrows passing by your head sounds awesome and gives the game intense atmosphere when your running into the heat of battle.\\nDefinitely worth the current 22,99 euro price tag.\\nMy score for the game would be a solid 8/10, superb multiplayer expirience.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"It started when I was playing along the peaceful economic single-player campaign having a tranquil time completing my little castle. I was supposed to make a bunch of bread and weapons, so I knew that I would have to create an efficient castle to be able to complete my task in the time limit. I first tried building a solid base of wood and food production to allow the construction of an array of weapon/bread facilities. But I slightly miscalculated causing starvation to the point everyone abandoned my city and before I could recover fires broke out in the farms and destroyed any hope of repopulating in time. So I restarted, and this time made sure that I would have ample production of food early on. However when I built my iron mines I didn't accompany them with enough hauler oxen so my miners were carrying each ingot back to my stockpile individually.\\nSo I restarted, and this time I was going to get it right. I built an efficient layout of early game farms, with a proper number of accompanying lumberjacks. I expanded to iron production and wheat farms early enough to get plenty of resources for weapon production. I even laid out a grid of wells to quench any fires that would start and fought off the occasional bandit raid without harm coming to my people. Soon I had a bustling little burb, but upon creating a few new buildings the scribe informed me that I had no new workers available and I needed to build a new hut. While I was building a few new houses, the scribe again popped up telling me that a fire had started in the baker's quarter. I had no worries since there were wells everywhere...until I realized that I hadn't put wells around my new baker shoppes. In a panic I watched as the new baker shoppes caught fire while the bakers were trying in vain to escape the flames. Soon my firemen were on top of things throwing pails of water on the problem, but the fire was spreading and jumping from building to building faster then the pails could be delivered. It took a long time before the firemen from the farms arrived to lend a hand dousing the final flames. I looked around my smoking castle and realized I had not lost a single building. Not one. My firemen had put out every building before it burned down. Then it dawned on me, none of my buildings were being worked. The fire had lasted so long that all of my workers had burned to death, and all my farmers, and all my miners, and anyone not carrying a bucket of water. But hope remained! I had a small remnant of food left in my granary to get going and maybe I could get my castle running again. And then a theif stole most of what was left.\\nSo now I am restarting.\\nI love this game.\",\n",

Well, when I picked up a copy on steam for a full $60 on release day, it was a greatly dissatisfying experience.

And my PC can run far better looking games with better performance rates.  It's a shame I can't refund this game since I have over 2 hours on this game, most of which was spent trying to find the best performing settings, which still proved fruitless.

This is my second favourite strategy game the first is AoE II HD Edition because it's without guns and it's a bit better in my opinion while playing. So AoE III has better graphics and audio than II but not only that the graphics are better but they extremely beautiful. The gameplay is good the missions are neither too easy or too hard i started playing on medium difficulty and its not that hard at the moment. There are added a lot more features to this game like you have levels and you can upgrade your home town + you can receive in-game bonuses to help you defeat your foes. I really recommend this game to all people who like strategy games though it would be better to get it on sale because it's really expensive. Rated 10/10!\",\n",
